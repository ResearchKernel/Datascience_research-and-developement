Abstract

We use the empirical evidence that F-spin multiplets exist in nuclei for only

selected states as an indication that F-spin can be regarded as a partial sym-

metry. We show that there is a class of non-F-scalar IBM-2 Hamiltonians with

partial F-spin symmetry, which reproduce the known systematics of collec-

tive bands in nuclei. These Hamiltonians predict that the scissors states have

good F-spin and form F-spin multiplets, which is supported by the existing

data.

The interacting boson model (IBM-2) [1–3] describes collective low-lying states in even-

even nuclei in terms of monople (sρ) and quadrupole (dρ) proton (ρ = π) and neutron

(ρ = ν) bosons. Microscopic, shell-model-based interpretation of the model [2,3] suggests

that the number of bosons of each type (Nρ) is ﬁxed and is taken as the sum of valence

proton and neutron particle and hole pairs counted from the nearest closed shell. The

algebra [2] with generators ˆF+ = s†

proton-neutron degrees of freedom are naturally reﬂected in the IBM-2 via an SU(2) F-spin
π · ˜dν, ˆF− = ( ˆF+)†, ˆF0 = ( ˆNπ − ˆNν)/2. The basic
νµ), with F-spin projection +1/2 (−1/2) for proton
(neutron) bosons. In a given nucleus, with ﬁxed Nπ, Nν, all states have the same value of

F-spin doublets are (s†

π, s†

ν), and (d†

πµ, d†

F0 = (Nπ − Nν)/2, while the allowed values of the F-spin quantum number F range from
|F0| to Fmax ≡ (Nπ + Nν)/2 ≡ N/2 in unit steps. F-spin characterizes the π-ν symmetry
properties of IBM-2 states. States with maximal F-spin, F ≡ Fmax, are fully symmetric
and correspond to the IBM-1 states with only one type of bosons [1]. There are several

arguments, e.g., the empirical success of IBM-1, the identiﬁcation of F-spin multiplets [4-7]

(series of nuclei with constant F and varying F0 with nearly constant excitation energies),

and weakness of M1 transitions, which lead to the belief that low lying collective states have

predominantly F = Fmax [8]. States with F < Fmax, correspond to ‘mixed-symmetry’ states,

most notably, the orbital magnetic dipole scissors mode [9] has by now been established

experimentally as a general phenomena in deformed even-even nuclei [10].

Various procedures have been proposed to estimate the F-spin purity of low lying states

[8]. These involve exploiting the data on M1 transitions (which should vanish between

pure F = Fmax states), extracting the diﬀerence in proton-neutron deformations from pion

charge exchange [11], using ratios of γ and ground band magnetic moments [12] and the

experimental g-factors of 2+

1 states [13], and considering the excitation energy of mixed

symmetry states.

In the majority of analyses the F-spin admixtures in low lying states

2

are found to be of a few percents (< 10%), typically 2% − 4% [8]. In spite of its appeal,
however, F-spin cannot be an exact symmetry of the Hamiltonian. The assumption of F-spin

scalar Hamiltonians is at variance with the microscopic interpretation of the IBM-2, which

necessitates diﬀerent eﬀective interactions between like and unlike nucleons. Furthermore,

if F-spin was a symmetry of the Hamiltonian, then all states would have good F-spin and

would be arranged in F-spin multiplets. Experimentally this is not case. As noted in an

analysis [5,6] of rare earth nuclei, the ground bands are in F-spin multiplets, whereas the

vibrational β bands and some γ bands do not form good F-spin multiplets. The empirical

situation in the deformed Dy-Os region is portrayed in Table I and Fig. 1. From Table

I it is seen that, for F > 13/2, the energies of the L = 2+ members of the γ bands vary

fast in the multiplet and not always monotonically. The variation in the energies of the β

bands is large and irregular. Thus both microscopic and empirical arguments rule out F-

spin invariance of the Hamiltonian. F-spin can at best be an approximate quantum number

which is good only for a selected set of states while other states are mixed. We are thus

confronted with a situation of having ‘special states’ endowed with a good symmetry which

does not arise from invariance of the Hamiltonian. These are precisely the characteristics

of a “partial symmetry” for which a non-scalar Hamiltonian produces a subset of special

(at times solvable) states with good symmetry. Such a symmetry notion [14] was recently

applied to nuclei [15], to molecules [16] and to the study of mixed systems with coexisting

regularity and chaos [17]. Previously determined [11] non-F-scalar Hamiltonians were shown

to have solvable ground bands with good F-spin. It is the purpose of this Letter to analyze

in detail these Hamiltonians and to show that their partial F-spin symmetry reproduces the

known systematics of ground and excited bands. In particular, we ﬁnd F-spin multiplets in

only selected bands, and observe common collective signatures for the ground and scissors

bands in deformed nuclei, e.g. the same F-spin purity and equal moments of inertia. We

3

further test a prediction for the existence of F-spin multiplets of scissors states.

The ground band in the IBM-2 is represented by an intrinsic state which is a product of

a proton condensate and a rotated neutron condensate with Nπ and Nν bosons respectively

[18]. It depends on the quadrupole deformations, βρ, γρ, (ρ = π, ν) of the proton-neutron

equilibrium shapes and on the relative orientation angles Ω between them. For βρ > 0, the

intrinsic state is deformed and members of the rotational ground-state band are obtained

from it by projection. It has been shown in [11] that the intrinsic state will have a well

deﬁned F-spin, F = Fmax, when the proton-neutron shapes are aligned and with equal

deformations. The conditions (βπ = βν,γπ = γν, Ω = 0) are weaker than the conditions for

F-spin invariance, which makes it possible for a non-F-scalar IBM-2 Hamiltonian to have

an equilibrium intrinsic state with pure F-spin. Since the angular momentum projection

operator is an F-spin scalar, the projected states of good L will also have good F = Fmax. A

non-F-spin scalar Hamiltonian which has the above equilibrium condensate as an eigenstate

is therefore guaranteed to have a ground band with good F-spin symmetry. Such explicit

construction of an IBM-2 Hamiltonian with partial F-spin symmetry was presented in [11]

for the most likely situation, namely, aligned axially symmetric (prolate) deformed shapes

(βρ = β, γρ = Ω = 0). In this case, the equilibrium deformed intrinsic state for the ground

band with F = Fmax has the form

|c; K = 0i ≡ |Nπ, Nνi = (Nπ!Nν!)−1/2(b†

therefore, with the SO(5) projection operator and hence produces F-spin multiplets with

good SO(5) symmetry. Such multiplets were reported in the Yb-Os region of γ-soft nuclei

[7].

The same conditions (βρ = β, γρ = Ω = 0) which resulted in F = Fmax for the condensate

of Eq. (1), ensure also F = Fmax − 1 for the intrinsic state representing the scissors band

The last term in Eq. (5) is the Majorana operator [1], related to the total F-spin operator

by ˆMπν = [ ˆN( ˆN + 2)/4− ˆF 2 ], with eigenvalues k(N − k + 1) for states with F = Fmax − k.
The Hamiltonian H ′ is non-F-scalar but is rotational invariant. If we add to it an SO(3)

rotation term, H ′ + λ ˆL2, ( ˆL = ˆLπ + ˆLν), the resulting Hamiltonian will have a subset of

solvable states which form the K = 0 ground band (L = 0, 2, 4, . . .) with F = Fmax, and the

K = 1 scissors band (L = 1, 2, 3 . . .) with F = Fmax − 1. The resulting spectrum is

Eg(L) = λ L(L + 1)

(F = Fmax)

Esc(L) = B N + λ L(L + 1)

(F = Fmax − 1)

(6)

where the Majorana coeﬃcient B may depend on the boson numbers and deformation

[8,19,20].

It follows that for such Hamiltonians, with partial F-spin symmetry, both the

ground and scissors band have good F-spin and have the same moment of inertia. The

6

latter derived property is in agreement with the conclusions of a recent comprehensive anal-

ysis of the scissors mode in heavy even-even nuclei [19], which concluded that, within the

experimental precisions (∼ 10%), the moment of inertia of the scissors mode are the same
as that of the ground band. It is the partial F-symmetry of the Hamiltonian (5) which is

responsible for the common signatures of collectivity in these two bands.

The Hamiltonian H ′ of Eq. (5) is not F-spin invariant, however, [ H ′, ~F ]|c; K = 0i =
[ H ′, ~F ]|sc; K = 1i = 0. This implies that members of both the ground and scissors bands
are expected to form F-spin multiplets. For ground bands such structures have been empiri-

cally established [4-7]. The prediction for F-spin multiplets of scissors states requires further

elaboration. Although the mean energy of the scissors mode is at about 3 MeV [20], the

observed fragmentation of the M1 strength among several 1+ states prohibits, unlike ground

bands, the use of nearly constant excitation energies as a criteria to identify F-spin multiplets

of scissors states. Instead, a more sensitive test of this suggestion comes from the summed
ground to scissors B(M1) strength. The IBM-2 M1 operator ( ˆLπ − ˆLν) is an F-spin vector
(F = 1, F0 = 0). Its matrix element between the ground state [L = 0+
g , (F = Fmax, F0)]

and scissors state [L = 1+

sc, (F ′ = F − 1, F0)] is proportional to an F-spin Clebsch Gordan
coeﬃcient CF,F0 = (F, F0; 1, 0|F − 1, F0) times a reduced matrix element. It follows that
sc)/(CF,F0)2 does not depend on F0 and should be a constant in a
the ratio B(M1; 0+

g → 1+

given F-spin multiplet. In Table II we list all F-spin partners for which the summed B(M1)

strength to the scissors mode has been measured todate [21,22]. It is seen that within the

experimental errors, the above ratio is fairly constant. The most noticeable discrepancy for

172Yb (F=8), arises from its measured low value of summed B(M1) strength. The latter

should be regarded as a lower limit due to experimental deﬁciencies (large background and

strong fragmentation [10]). These observations strengthen the contention of high F-spin

purity and formation of F-spin multiplets of scissors states.

7

As noted in [5,6] and shown in Table I and Fig. 1, for nuclei with F = 6, 6.5, also

members of the γ bands display constant excitation energies and seem to form good F-

spin multiplets. This empirical observation has a natural explanation within the family of
Hamiltonians with partial F-spin symmetry. For the choice β = √

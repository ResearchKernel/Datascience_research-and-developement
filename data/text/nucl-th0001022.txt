Abstract

We present a model for dressing the nucleon propagator and vertices. In
the model the use of a K-matrix approach (unitarity) and dispersion relations
(analyticity) are combined. The principal application of the model lies in
pion-nucleon scattering where we discuss eﬀects of the dressing on the phase
shifts.

I. INTRODUCTION

The properties of unitarity and analyticity have been exploited in various theoretical
approaches to pion-nucleon scattering. Unitarity is usually implemented either by solving a
relativistic wave equation for the scattering amplitude [1–5] or using a K-matrix formalism
[6–9]. Analytic properties, which are related to the condition of causality, have allowed one
to derive useful dispersion relations for various amplitudes [10,11].

In the present work we have developed an approach in which constraints due to both
unitarity and analyticity are incorporated by using both a K-matrix method [6,9] and dis-
persion relations [10,12]. The approch used consists of two separate stages.
In the ﬁrst
eﬀective 2- and 3-point Green’s functions (i.e. propagators and vertices) are built which
incorporate non-perturbative dressing due to regular (non-pole) parts of loop diagrams. In
the second stage a K-matrix formalism is used to calculate the T-matrix, where the kernel,
the K-matrix, is constructed from tree-level diagrams using the dressed vertices and prop-
agators calculated in the ﬁrst stage. Through the use of the K-matrix formalism the pole
contributions are taken into account which were left out in the ﬁrst stage. The T-matrix
obtained from thus constructed K-matrix will contain the principal value parts of loop in-
tegrals, which is important for implementing analyticity in the K-matrix framework. The
model as presented is geared to the calculation of pion-nucleon scattering and includes a
consistent dressing of interacting nucleons, expanding the method of Ref. [13]. Since the
dressing is formulated in terms of eﬀective vertices and propagators through the use of form
factors and self-energies, a broader application might be possible.

In the calculation of the propagators and vertices a technique based on the use of dis-
persion relations is used. This allows us to arrange the dressing of the nucleon such that
the only πNN vertices needed throughout the procedure are those with one virtual external
nucleon line (half-oﬀ-shell vertices). For the construction of the K-matrix we also need only
these πNN vertices. Being interacting 3-point Green’s functions, such vertices are not mea-
surable quantities. In particular, they depend on the representation of interpolating ﬁelds
in the Lagrangian. A wide class of ﬁeld transformations leave the S-matrix (and therefore
the observables) invariant while changing the interaction Lagrangian and hence the vertices
[14–17]. In this work all calculations are performed in a particular representation in which
self-energies and vertex modiﬁcations are calculated consistently with the K-matrix. In par-
ticular, 4- and higher-point Green’s functions are absent in this representation. In Section V
we show that the ﬁeld ambiguity can be taken advantage of to change to a diﬀerent rep-
resentation in which the nucleon self-energy vanishes and no 4- (or higher-) point vertices
are introduced. While leading to the same observables in virtue of the equivalence theorem
[14,16], this representation is convenient for interpreting the eﬀects of nucleon dressing in
terms of eﬀective πNN vertices. Rather soft form factors in 3-point vertices are dynamically
generated through the dressing.

In the dressing it is essential to include the low-lying meson and baryon degrees of free-
dom, in particular, beside the pion, the ρ– and σ– mesons and the ∆–resonance. The
associated coupling parameters were ﬁxed by considering phase shifts for pion-nucleon scat-
tering. A good agreement could be obtained for pion energies exceeding 400 MeV, adjusting
only 5 parameters. The requirement that the dressing procedure converges for a given bare
πNN form factor puts additional constraints on the allowed range of these parameters.

In discussing the calculated phase shifts, we focus primarily on eﬀects of the dressing.
These can be regarded as eﬀects of the the explicit inclusion of the principal value parts
of loop integrals (which are omitted in the usual approximation for the K-matrix [6,8,9]).
Eﬀects of principal value parts were also considered in Ref. [1] in a calculation based on
three-dimentional reductions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. In our approach we have kept
the most general Lorentz structure for the πNN vertex. Another diﬀerence with [1] is that
we obtain the principal value parts through the use of dispersion integrals.

A general description of the model is given in Section II. Details of the calculation of
the main building blocks of the K-matrix – dressed vertices and propagators – are given
in Sections III and IV, respectively. In Section V we construct a representation which is
convenient for interpreting results of the dressing. Eﬀects of the dressing on calculated phase
shifts for pion-nucleon scattering are discussed in Section VI. Concluding remarks are made
in Section VII.

II. OUTLINE OF THE MODEL

We start by giving the main formulae of the K-matrix approach in the context of pion-
nucleon scattering. The S-matrix S is expressed in terms of the scattering amplitude T (the
T-matrix) by

In principle, the T-matrix can be obtained by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation,

S = 1 + 2iT .

T = V + V G T ,

(2)

where the kernel (potential) V is the sum of irreducible diagrams describing the scattering,
and G is a dressed πN propagator.
value (regular) parts,

In general, any integral over the 4-momenta in G can be split into its pole and principal

G = iδ + GR,

(3)

where the pole part iδ is the contribution of the real (on-mass-shell) πN state, and GR cor-
responds to the propagation of virtual (oﬀ-shell) nucleon and pion. According to Cutkosky
rules [19], iδ contains the imaginary parts of the invariant functions which parametrize G,
and GR contains the real parts.
It is this separation of the pole and principal value parts of propagators that is exploited
in the K-matrix formalism. Namely, on deﬁning the K-matrix by the equation

Eq. (2) can be written in the form

K = V + V GR K ,

T = K + K iδ T .

(4)

(5)

This can be formally solved, yielding the central equation of the K-matrix method [18]:

The real parts of the form factors and self-energy functions are calculated at every
iteration step by applying dispersion relations [10,12] to the imaginary parts. For example,
for the form factors at the iteration step n we have

Re Gn

i (p2) = G0

i (p2) + P

for an incoming virtual nucleon. Here GS(p2) and GV (p2) are pseudoscalar and pseudovector
form factors, τα, α = 1, 2, 3, are Pauli isospin matrices, and P+(p) ≡ (p/ + M)/(2M). In the
course of the dressing procedure the most general structure Eq. (8) of the πNN vertex is
maintained.

The bare vertex in the dressing procedure is chosen as

GV (p2) = fN (1 − χ) G0(p2)

, GS(p2) = fN χ G0(p2)

(9)

with

G0(p2) = exp"− ln 2

(p2 − M 2)2

where q and q′ are the 4-momenta of the pions with isospin indices α and β respectively,
k = q − q′ and (ˆeαβγ) = −iǫαβγ. The ρ-meson carries the isospin index γ and the Lorentz
vector index ν. gρππ and gσππ are coupling constants (the values of all coupling constants
will be given later).

For the vertices discussed in this section a generic form factor Fr is introduced whose

functional form is similar to that of the bare πNN form factor given in Eq. (10):

Fr(p2

r) = exp"− ln 2

(p2

spin-1/2 part of the ∆ propagator is proportional to either pµ or pν. Thus only the spin-3/2
part of the ∆ propagator gives rise to non-vanishing matrix elements [23], and it suﬃces to
calculate only the spin-3/2 part of the ∆ self-energy.

IV. DRESSED PROPAGATORS

The inverse of the dressed nucleon propagator can be written as

with the self-energy given by

S −1(p) = p/ − M − Σ(p),

Σ(p) = ΣL(p) − (Z2 − 1)(p/ − M) − Z2 δM.

Here ΣL(p) is the contribution of pion loops,

ΣL(p) = A(p2)p/ + B(p2)M,

(18)

(19)

(20)

parametrized by the “self-energy functions” A(p2) and B(p2). The ﬁeld and mass renormal-
ization constants Z2 and δM are ﬁxed by requiring that the propagator have a simple pole
with a unit residue at p/ = M. This yields

Z2 = 1 + Re A(M 2) + 2M 2 d

The meson propagators are dressed through the insertion of a ππ loop as described in

Section II A. The pion propagator thus remains undressed.

The dressed propagator of the σ-meson has the form

D(p2) =

1

invariant [15,16]. The invariance of the S-matrix under ﬁeld transformations is known as
the equivalence theorem [14,16].

In this Section we will take advantage of this irrelevance of representation and transform
the eﬀect of the dressing of the nucleon propagator into new πNN vertices. The represen-
tation constructed in this Section is an example of the “physical representation” discussed
in Ref. [24].

We introduce the notation where the subscript Σ labels the representation where the
propagator S contains a non-trivial self-energy. The new representation is deﬁned by the
two requirements: 1) the nucleon propagator must be equal to the free propagator S0(p), 2)
it must be possible to construct the K-matrix as in Fig. (1), i. e. solely in terms of 2- and
3-point Green’s functions. The new πNN vertex Γ must thus be a solution of the equation

Γ(p) S0(p)

N = 2 GeV2 and Λ2

An important characteristic of the bare vertex is its half-width Λ2

N , see Eq. (10). To
investigate the dependence of the dressing on Λ2
N , calculations have been done for two values,
Λ2
N = 3 GeV2, referred to as calculations (I) and (II), respectively. The
requirement that a converged solution of the dressing procedure can be obtained, without
developing additional poles of the propagator (see Section V), puts an upper bound on Λ2
N .
While the exact value of this limit depends also on other parameters of the model, it is
certain that the bare form factor cannot be arbitrarily hard. Note however that the scale
introduced by the bare form factor, which is of the order of M 2 + Λ2
N , is larger than the scale
due to the degrees of freedom explicitly included in the dressing. The values of the bare
coupling constant fN , introduced in Eq. (9), are given in Table II, where also the values of
the ﬁeld and mass renormalization constants are listed.

We ﬁnd that a sizable pseudoscalar admixture in the bare vertex (with |χ| > 0.1 in
Eq. (9)) leads to a poor description of low energy phase shifts. This is intimately related
to the smallness of explicit chiral-symmetry breaking. Besides, even without resorting to
phenomenology, the range of variation of χ is severely constrained by the requirement of
convergence. Both calculations presented in this work were done with χ = 0.055.

The values of the parameters in the vertices for the ∆-resonance and ρ- and σ-mesons,
Eqs. (12 - 17), are summarized in Table III. The constants gπN ∆, gρππ and gσππ were ﬁxed
from the decay widths of the ∆, ρ and σ [26]. The value of half-width Λ2, see Eq. (14), was
kept ﬁxed and had to be suﬃciently soft to provide convergence of the dressing procedure.
∆, were chosen from
a comparison of the calculated πN phase shifts with the data, taken from [27]. Together
with χ, discussed above, the ﬁve adjustable parameters are given in the last ﬁve columns in
Table III. It should be stressed that only for a rather restricted range of these constants a
convergent solution of the dressing procedure could be found.

The coupling constants gρN N , κρ, gσN N , as well as the parameter fm2

The phase shifts in pion-nucleon scattering are shown in Figs. (3) and (5) as function of
the pion kinetic energy in the laboratory system, corresponding to calculations (I) and (II),
respectively. The solid lines are the phase shifts calculated with the dressed K-matrix as
shown in Fig. (1). The dashed lines are obtained in the approximation where K is set equal
to the potential V , hence without taking the dressing into account.

The eﬀect of the dressing on the πNN vertex, can be seen more clearly from Figs. (4)
(calculation(I)) and (6) (calculation (II)). The form factors are shown as functions of p2, the
invariant mass squared of the virtual nucleon. The representation constructed in Section V
is particularly useful because in it the nucleon propagator is free and the eﬀects of nucleon
V,S(p2) between the dressed
dressing are encapsulated solely in the diﬀerence GV,S(p2) − G0
and bare πNN form factors. For this reason we do not present results for the self-energy
functions. It should be stressed that in virtue of the equivalence theorem [14,16], either of
the two representations described in Section V lead to identical results for the phase shifts.
The upper and lower panels contain pseudovector and pseudoscalar form factors, respectively
(please note that Fig. (4) and Fig. (6) have diﬀerent vertical scales). The dotted lines are
the bare form factors, see Eq. (9), with the constants fN and χ given in Tables II and III.
The dashed lines are the form factors obtained after the ﬁrst iteration step (essentially, a
one-loop correction to the bare vertex) and the solid lines are the fully dressed form factors.
A comparison of the solid and dashed lines exhibits a non-perturbative aspect of the dressing
in the sense that it goes beyond an inclusion of few loop corrections. It can be seen that the

11

ratio of pseudoscalar and pseudovector form factors remains small if the nucleon is not far oﬀ
the mass-shell. The dash-dotted curves correspond to the form factors in the representation
where the nucleon self-energy has not been eliminated. We see that the dressed πNN vertex
may depend signiﬁcantly on the representation chosen.

Comparing the form factors in Fig. (4) with those in Fig. (6), we conclude that the
converged solution depends strongly on the width of the bare form factor. However, inde-
pendent of this width, the dressing causes considerable softening of the form factor at higher
invariant masses. The results shown in Figs. (3) and (5) suggest that it is possible to obtain
a reasonable description of phase shifts up to pion laboratory energies of about 400 MeV
starting from bare form factors with rather diﬀerent widths.

In this model only one resonance of the πN scattering, the ∆, was included. The lack
of other resonances becomes especially conspicuous at higher energies. In fact, in the cal-
culations of phase shifts we also included the Roper resonance, though it is not taken into
account in the dressing. This improved the calculated P11 phase shift at energies of about
300 MeV and higher, with a negligible eﬀect on the other phase shifts. In principle, the
Roper can be easily included in the dressing, as well as other important degrees of freedom
(for example, the S11-resonance). In the present version of the model we have forgone doing
so, limiting ourselves to the lowest lying ∆-resonance only.

VII. CONSLUSIONS

We have presented a model in which considerations of unitarity and anlyticity (causality)
are implemented in the K-matrix approach to pion-nucleon scattering. The principal ingre-
dient of the model is the dressing procedure, formulated in terms of half-oﬀ-shell vertices
and propagators, the building blocks of the K-matrix. Analyticity properties are exploited
through the use of dispersion relations to obtain the principal value parts of loop integrals
required for the unitarization of the scattering amplitude.

The ﬁve parameters of the model are constrained rather much by the requirement of con-
vergence of the dressing procedure. By the same token, there is an implicit interdependence
of the parameters. This means that a comparison with experiment is an important test for
this approach. We showed that a good overall description of phase shifts in pion-nucleon
scattering can be achieved at the energies exceeding the scale due to the degrees of free-
dom explicit in the model. This suggests that the developed dressing procedure provides a
physically reasonable method for studying higher-order correction to the (unitarized) Born
approximation traditionally adopted in the K-matrix approach.

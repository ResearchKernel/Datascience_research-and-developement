It is commonly assumed that Shor’s quantum algorithm for the eﬃcient factorization of a large
number N requires a pure initial state. Here we demonstrate that a single pure qubit together with a
collection of log2N qubits in an arbitrary mixed state is suﬃcient to implement Shor’s factorization
algorithm eﬃciently.

be extended to other problems of practical relevance. In
this paper we demonstrate that a single pure qubit to-
gether with an initial supply of log2 N qubits in an ar-
bitrarily mixed state is suﬃcient to implement Shor’s
algorithm for the factorization of the number N eﬃ-
ciently. This is the smallest number of pure states that
can achieve this task. We also demonstrate that the ef-
ﬁciency of the modiﬁed algorithm is essentially indepen-
dent of the degree of mixing of the log2 N qubits.

We proceed by outlining the problem addressed in
Shor’s algorithm, followed by the formulation of Shor’s
algorithm introduced in [8]. Then we will describe the
necessary modiﬁcations to this algorithm, that will allow
it to be executed using a single pure qubit and log2 N
qubits in a maximally mixed state.

The basis of Shor’s algorithm is a classical order ﬁnd-
ing method which, recast as a quantum algorithm, can
be executed in polynomial time, requiring only a polyno-
mial amount of additional classical computation to com-
pute the factors of N . The factors of a number N = pq
can, with high probability, be found if the period or
order, r, (the lowest positive integer x 6= 0 such that
fa(x) = 1 ) of the element a in the space of the function
fa(x) = axmod N, is known. Then, provided a is coprime
to N (which can be checked classically in polynomial time
using Euclid’s algorithm), there is a high probability that

The discovery of a quantum algorithm for the eﬃcient
factorization of large numbers [1] has started a rapid de-
velopment of quantum information processing [2]. Fol-
lowing this ground-breaking result a number of experi-
mentally realizable proposals for the implementation of
quantum computers have been made, for example, in ion
trap systems [3] or Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
schemes [4]. These systems are distinguished by a low de-
coherence rate combined with a comparatively high gate
speed and therefore promise the possibility of executing
many quantum gates. While noise in these systems can
be made small in principle, it nevertheless imposes limi-
tations to the maximal size of the computation [5] and to
the achievable quality (e.g. the purity) of the initial state
of the quantum computer. It would therefore be inter-
esting to see whether a quantum computation necessarily
requires the preparation of an initial state of high purity,
or whether some parts of the quantum computer may be
left in a mixed state. Such a result would be of partic-
ular interest in NMR systems in which it is diﬃcult to
prepare physically pure quantum states of nuclear spins.

The use of mixed states in quantum algorithms has had
little discussion as yet. Note, however, the work of Schul-
man and Vazirani [7] in which they demonstrated that,
starting from a set of qubits each in a thermal state, one
can obtain a certain number of pure qubits using a quan-
tum algorithm. These were then envisaged to be used
for a quantum computation, while all the other qubits
which are in a mixed state are discarded. If the initial
states are in a thermal mixture at high temperature, the
number of mixed quantum states and quantum gates re-
quired to obtain even a single pure qubit is very high. It
would greatly enhance the eﬃciency of this approach if
it would be possible to reduce the necessary number of
pure qubits as much as possible at the expense of em-
ploying some of the mixed qubits in the actual quantum
computation. Recently, Knill and Laﬂamme [6] have in-
vestigated the power of quantum computation when only
a single pure qubit together with a supply of maximally
mixed states is available. They were able to construct
a problem that such a system can solve more eﬃciently
than the best currently known classical algorithm.

It would be interesting to see whether these ideas can

”phase-kickback” technique [8] requiring the conditional
unitary transformation given by

cUa |0i |xi = |0i |xi ; cUa |1i |xi = |1i |ax mod N i .

The eﬀect of applying the controlled unitary transform
to the state (|0i + |1i) |ψji is

This tells us that if we set up an algorithm that actu-
ally ﬁnds the order of a random sequence we still have a
good chance that this order is in fact r.

The r eigenstates of Ua in equation 1 are orthogonal su-
perpositions of the members of the sequence with g = 1.
In exactly the same way we can form the remaining N −r
eigenstates of Ua as orthogonal superpositions of mem-
bers of each of the other sequences. We write these as

The unitarity of the transform together with the fact
that it maps a ’number’ state |xi to a ’number’ state
|ax mod N i means that on repeated application of Ua
periodic sequences are induced on all the numbers x =
0, 1, · · · , N − 1, that is, there is an R(x) such that
U R(x)
|xi = |xi. We may write the members of all pos-
sible sequences as |gax mod N i for some g and x. For ex-
ample, for a = 2 and N = 15 on repeated application of
Ua the possible sequences are

a

g = 1 :

g = 3 :
g = 5 :

g = 7 :

|1i → |2i → |4i → |8i → |1i

|3i → |6i → |12i → |9i → |3i
|5i → |10i → |5i

|7i → |14i → |13i → |11i → |7i .

It is the ﬁrst of these sequences (with g = 1) whose
number of members is what we previously called the
’order’, r, of a modulo N and it is this period that we
need to ﬁnd to factorize N . However, there is a relation-
ship between the order of the sequence with g = 1 and
the orders of all the other sequences with g 6= 1. We
will label each of the diﬀerent sequences by d and the
number of members in each sequence by rd. Ua obeys
the condition U r
a = I so it is clear that rd|r, that is, the
orders of all the sequences divides that of the sequence
with g = 1. In fact we will ﬁnd that nearly all of the
numbers 0, 1, · · · , N − 1 are contained within a sequence
that has the same order as the ﬁrst sequence. We can
ﬁnd a lower bound on the probability that for a number
g ∈ 0, 1, · · · , N − 1 the state |gaxmodN i is contained
within a sequence of order r.

Theorem 1 Given two prime numbers p and q
we deﬁne r as the lowest positive integer x such that
ax − 1 ≡ 0 mod (pq) for an arbitrary integer a. Then
gax − g ≡ 0 mod (pq) with x < r for at most p + q − 1
values of g in the interval 0 ≤ a ≤ pq − 1.

Proof: If gcd(g, pq) = 1 then g(ax − 1) ≡ 0 mod pq ⇒
ax − 1 ≡ 0 mod pq and therefore x = r. There are
(p − 1)(q − 1) positive integers less than and coprime
to pq, which proves the theorem 2

We can now see that the probability, Pr, of picking
g at random such that the lowest x for which gax ≡
g mod (pq) is r, is Pr ≥ (pq − (p + q − 1))/pq = (p − 1)(q −
1)/pq which approaches unity as p and q become large.

the pure qubit. Then it can be checked, that this bipar-
tite system can have negative partial transpose and is
therefore entangled [13].

In the following we will prove strictly that this mod-
iﬁed version of Shor’s algorithm is indeed still eﬃcient
for order ﬁnding. Shor’s algorithm requires O (log log r)
repetitions for it to have a high chance of ﬁnding the
order whereas the mixed state Shor’s algorithm uses ex-
actly the same resources as Shor’s original algorithm but
requires

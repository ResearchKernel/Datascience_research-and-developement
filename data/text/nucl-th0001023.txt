Abstract

Shell corrections of the ﬁnite deformed Woods-Saxon potential are calculated
using the Green’s function method and the generalized Strutinsky smoothing
procedure. They are compared with the results of the standard prescription
which are aﬀected by the spurious contribution from the unphysical particle
gas. In the new method, the shell correction approaches the exact limit pro-
vided that the dimension of the single-particle (harmonic oscillator) basis is
suﬃciently large. For spherical potentials, the present method is faster than
the exact one in which the contribution from the particle continuum states is
explicitly calculated. For deformed potentials, the Green’s function method
oﬀers a practical and reliable way of calculating shell corrections for weakly
bound nuclei.

I. INTRODUCTION

The positive-energy spectrum of the average single-particle potential plays a role in the
description of weakly bound nuclei for which the Fermi level approaches zero (see Ref. [1]).
For these nuclei, important for both nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics studies, spe-
cial care should be taken when dealing with the particle continuum which seriously impacts
many nuclear properties, including bulk nuclear properties (e.g., masses, radii, shapes) as
well as nuclear dynamics (i.e., excitation modes).

In two earlier papers [2,3], a macroscopic-microscopic method was applied to nuclei far
from the beta stability line.
It has been demonstrated that the positive-energy single-
particle spectrum does impact the results signiﬁcantly, and the systematic error in binding
energies, due to the neglect or the improper treatment of the particle continuum, can be
as large as several MeV at the neutron drip line. In the ﬁrst paper [2], both spherical and
deformed nuclei were considered, and the continuum was approximated by a limited number
of quasistationary states which resulted from a diagonalization of the Woods-Saxon average
potential in a harmonic oscillator basis. In the vicinity of the neutron drip line, the result of
the Strutinsky smoothing (standard averaging method) becomes unreliable and it deviates
from the result of the semiclassical Wigner-Kirkwood expansion. The semiclassical method,
which does not use the positive-energy spectrum explicitly, gives a more reliable estimate of
the shell correction than the standard method (see Refs. [4,2] and references quoted therein).
In the following study [3], carried out for spherically symmetric nuclei, a more detailed
comparison was carried out between the Strutinsky smoothing method and the Wigner-
Kirkwood expansion. In the Strutinsky method, the continuum eﬀect was taken into account
exactly, i.e., by calculating the continuum part of the level density from the derivative of
the scattering phase shift with respect to single-particle energy. The smooth part of the
continuum level density has been calculated by means of the contour integration along a
path in the complex energy plane [5]. Although the continuum level density was treated
properly, it has been concluded [3] that in most nuclei the plateau condition of the Strutinsky
method [6] could not be met. Therefore, this condition was replaced with the requirement
of the linear energy dependence of the mean level density. This modiﬁcation (which widens
the range of the applicability of the Strutinsky procedure considerably) is referred to as the
generalized Strutinsky method. The new procedure has proved to be very useful; in most
cases it gives results reasonably close to the estimate of the semiclassical method. The
exceptions are the neutron drip-line nuclei in which the neutron Fermi level approaches zero
and the semiclassical procedure diverges [3].

In the present work, the eﬀect of the particle continuum on shell correction is further
studied for both spherical and deformed nuclei by using the recently introduced Green’s
function approach [7,8]. The advantage of this method is that, by diagonalizing the ﬁnite
single-particle potential in a square-integrable basis, one can get rid of the spurious contri-
bution of the particle gas to the level density. We shall refer to this novel method as the new
method in order to distinguish it from the commonly used standard smoothing procedure
(or: old method) in which the spurious contribution from the particle gas is not subtracted
(but diminished by using a reduced number of basis states).

The paper is organized as follows. Section II contains a brief review of the shell-correction
method and describes several versions of the smoothing procedure used. The numerical

2

results of shell-correction calculations are presented in Sec. III for both neutron-rich and
proton-rich nuclei. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Sec. IV.

II. STRUTINSKY SMOOTHING PROCEDURE

A. Basic Deﬁnitions

In the macroscopic-microscopic approach [6,9–12], the shell correction,

δEshell = Es.p. − ˜Es.p.,

is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the total single-particle energy Es.p.,

Es.p. = Xi−occ

ǫi,

(1)

(2)

and the smooth single-particle energy ˜Es.p.. The shell correction represents the ﬂuctuating
part of the binding energy resulting from the quantal single-particle shell structure.

For the sake of simplicity, we shall assume that the single-nucleon energy spectrum is

that of a one-body Hamiltonian,

ˆH = ˆT + ˆV ,

(3)

with an average single-particle potential ˆV . In practice, the potential contains a deformed
Woods-Saxon potential, the spin-orbit term and the Coulomb potential. Since the central
potential is ﬁnite, the spectrum of ˆH is composed of bound states with discrete negative
eigenvalues (ǫi < 0) and the continuum of scattering states with positive energies (ǫ > 0).
Consequently, the single-particle level density is

where

g(ǫ) = gd(ǫ) + gc(ǫ),

gd(ǫ) = Xi

2 δ(ǫ − ǫi)

(4)

(5)

is the level density of the discrete (bound) states and gc(ǫ) is the continuum level density
(it will be speciﬁed later). The factor 2 in Eq. (5) appears due to the two-fold Kramers
degeneracy of the deformed single-particle energy levels.

In the shell-correction method [9,10], ˜Es.p. is calculated by employing the smoothed level

density ˜g(ǫ) obtained from g(ǫ) by folding it with a smoothing function f (x):

1

˜g(ǫ) =

˜λ

ǫ ˜g(ǫ)dǫ,

(7)

˜Es.p. = Z

−∞

and the smoothed Fermi level ˜λ. The latter is obtained from the particle number equation:

˜λ

˜g(ǫ)dǫ.

(8)

N = Z

−∞

The smooth single-particle energy and the resulting shell correction have to be deﬁned
unambigously. Therefore, they must neither depend on the smoothing range γ nor on the
order p of the curvature correction. This requirement, referred to as the plateau condition,
can be written as

d ˜Es.p.

˜g(ǫ) = Xi

f  ǫ − wi

where ˆG+(z) = (z − ˆH + i0)−1 and ˆG+
0 (z) = (z − ˆH0 + i0)−1 is the free outgoing Green’s
operator associated with ˆH0 = ˆT . The interpretation of Eq. (14) is straightforward: the
second term contains the contribution to the single-particle level density originating from
the gas of free particles.

Let us now introduce an approximation to the exact expression (14). To this end, we
diagonalize ˆH and ˆH0 in an orthonormal basis formed from the M square-integrable basis
functions. The resulting approximate eigenenergies of ˆH and ˆH0 are denoted by ei and e0
i ,
respectively (i=1,...,M). This procedure amounts to a projection of both Hamiltonians into
the M-dimensional Hilbert space of square-integrable basis functions. The level density (4)
can then be approximated by the diﬀerence of the discrete level densities of the two projected
Hamiltonians:

gM (ǫ) =

M

Xi=1

2δ(ǫ − ei) −

2δ(ǫ − e0

i ).

M

Xi=1

(15)

By increasing the dimension M, the bound eigenvalues of ˆH converge to the exact single-
particle energies while the positive-energy eigenvalues will tend to approach zero energy.
The eigenvalues e0
i , which are obviously diﬀerent from the positive energies ei for any ﬁnite
M, can, in fact, compensate for the spurious increase of the level density around the zero
energy if the smoothing procedure (6) is applied:

1

˜gM (ǫ) =

ǫu − ǫl = 1.5 ¯hω0,

(17)

the deviation of g(ǫ, γ, p) from linearity should be minimal [3].
minimize the deviation

In practice, one has to

χ2(γ, p) = Z ǫu

ǫl

[g(ǫ, γ, p) − a − bǫ]2 dǫ,

(18)

where the parameters a and b are uniquely determined for each value of γ and p by the
method of least squares.

Figure 1 displays χ2 as a function of γ and p for the neutrons in the spherical superheavy
nucleus Z=114, N=184. It is seen that χ2 has two minima for each p value, and there is a
clear correlation between p and γ (minima are shifted to larger values of γ with increasing
p). The position of the ﬁrst minimum is between 1.12 and 1.48 ¯hω0 (i.e., between 6.6 MeV
and 8.6 MeV). The second minimum appears at larger γ values, namely between 7.7 MeV
and 12 MeV. As demonstrated in Ref. [3], the average level densities corresponding to the
ﬁrst minimum of χ2 practically do not depend on p in the negative energy region. This is
also valid for the second minimum in χ2. However, a diﬀerence can be seen if one compares
average level densities calculated at diﬀerent minima. The inset of Fig. 1 shows ˜g(ǫ) for
both minima at p=10. The level density corresponding to the lower-γ minimum preserves
its linearity for a wider range of energies, and the linearity is best fulﬁlled in the energy
region which is midway at the bottom and the top of the potential. Therefore, in our
calculations [Eq. (18)] we ﬁxed the energy interval so that it is centered around the half of
the energy of the lowest single-particle level. Far from this central region g(ǫ) varies rapidly
and this forces the smoothed level density to oscillate. These oscillations can be viewed as
end eﬀects, and they are largely independent of the shell structure. For example, for the
harmonic oscillator potential whose spectrum has no natural upper bound, these oscillations
occur around the bottom of the potential well. For the Woods-Saxon potential, additional
oscillations occur around the threshold energy.

It is well known that the realistic value of the smoothing parameter γ has to lie in a
certain energy interval [22]. The value of γ should be large enough to wipe out shell eﬀects
in the energy range of a typical distance between shells, but it should not be much larger
to avoid bringing the threshold oscillations down to lower energies. To prevent this, in our
calculations we always use the γ values corresponding to the ﬁrst minimum of χ2. For the
case shown in Fig. 1, shell correction changes by 0.3 MeV if one uses the value of γ at the
second minimum instead. While in this case the change in shell correction is well within the
uncertainty of the model, the diﬀerence is more pronounced for lighter nuclei. For the very
light nuclei, the end eﬀects dominate the energy dependence of ˜g(ǫ) in the whole energy
range. Consequently, the Strutinsky smoothing method cannot be meaningfully applied to
these systems.

III. RESULTS

A. Model Parameters

In the calculations presented in this work, we have used the average, axially deformed
Woods-Saxon (WS) potential of Ref. [23], which contains the central part, the spin-orbit

7

term, and the Coulomb potential for protons. The potential depends on a set of deformation
parameters, βλ, deﬁning the nuclear surface:

R(θ; β) = C(β)r

A1/3"1 +Xλ

◦

βλYλ0(θ)# ,

(19)

where the coeﬃcient C assures that the total volume enclosed by the surface (19) is con-
served. The Coulomb potential has been assumed to be that of the charge (Z −1)e uniformly
distributed within the deformed nuclear surface. We employed the set of WS parameters
introduced in Ref. [24]. For details pertaining to the WS model, see Refs. [2,23].

The deformed WS Hamiltonian was diagonalized in the deformed harmonic oscillator
basis using the computer code of Ref. [23]. For the diagonalization we took all the (stretched)
oscillator states having the principal quantum number less or equal than Nmax. (In short,
we took Nmax deformed shells.) The diagonalization of ˆH0 was carried out in precisely the
same basis.

When adopting the new scheme, the important question is how many harmonic oscillator
shells are needed in order to reproduce the exact results of Ref. [3]. Naturally, the value of
Nmax depends on the size and the shape of the potential to be diagonalized, and also on the
oscillator frequency ¯hω = η¯hω0 (the default value of η is 1.2).

The convergence of δEshell for neutrons as a function of Nmax is illustrated in Fig. 2 for
132Sn and 154Sn (which is weakly bound). One can see that for both nuclei the shell correction
obtained in the new procedure quickly converges to the exact value, and at Nmax=30 the
agreement is very satisfactory. Therefore, in the following, we shall use 30 oscillator shells
when applying the new method.

As expected, the results of calculations using the standard method do not stabilize
with Nmax. However, for the recommended values of Nmax=12 and 14, the shell correction
produced with the old method diﬀers from the exact value by less than 1 MeV. However
this apparent agreement seems to be accidental. We display in Fig. 2c and 2d, respectively,
the single-particle energy and the smoothed single-particle energy for 154Sn as a function
of Nmax. One can notice that at Nmax=12 the total single-particle energy diﬀers from the
exact value by about 8 MeV. Since the corresponding smoothed single-particle energy is
also shifted by about 8.5 MeV, the resulting shell correction diﬀers only by 0.8 MeV from
the exact value. Consequently, an acceptable agreement for δEshell comes as a result of
cancellation between two large numbers, each subject to large errors. As one approaches
the neutron drip line, the accurate calculation of single-particle energies requires a rather
high number of shells and/or a basis optimization with respect to the parameter η which
determines the oscillator length. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 which shows the convergence of
the total neutron single-particle energy for 120Zr at a large quadrupole deformation β2=0.6.
Clearly, for a weakly bound and deformed nucleus one needs at least Nmax=30 oscillator
shells to reach the convergence with the standard value of η. Of course, by increasing the
oscillator length, i.e., by choosing a smaller value of η, one can improve the convergence
signiﬁcantly for a system with a spatially extended density. In this example, one can arrive
at a reasonably accurate value of Es.p. by using Nmax=20 and η=0.8. Another practical way
of improving the convergence of single-particle energies is to use the modiﬁed oscillator basis
obtained by means of the local scaling transformation [25].

Figure 4 shows the neutron smoothed level density for 132Sn, a relatively well bound

8

nucleus, calculated with diﬀerent methods. The new method with Nmax=30 describes very
well ˜g(ǫ) in the whole region of negative energies. This proves that the Green’s function
approach can be used with conﬁdence, even for weakly bound systems. On the other hand,
the average level density obtained with the standard method never stops increasing, and its
deviation from the exact result shows up already at ǫ=–18 MeV. The result displayed in
Fig. 4 demonstrates that even for well-bound nuclei, the shell corrections calculated using
the old method are prone to signiﬁcant errors.

B. Deformation Eﬀects

In order to investigate the deformation dependence of shell corrections, we performed
calculations for 100,110,120Zr as a function of β2 (other deformation parameters were assumed
to be zero). In the Green’s function variant, the generalized plateau condition was used; the
resulting values of γ were also employed in the standard Strutinsky calculations. The results
are shown in Fig. 5. As expected, the most pronounced diﬀerence between the results of the
two methods is for the weakly bound nucleus, 120Zr. This diﬀerence does depend on β2; part
of it can be attributed to the deformation dependence of the smoothing width. (It should
be noted that in the deformed calculations of Ref. [2] γ was assumed to be constant.)

Since the eﬀect of the particle continuum on δEshell should be less pronounced for systems
that are bound better, one would expect the two methods to yield similar results for lighter
Zr isotopes. However, as seen in Fig. 4, the diﬀerence between both methods is negligible
only at very low energies, ǫ<18 MeV. For higher values of ǫ (or Fermi level ˜λ), the diﬀerence
between the smoothed level densities is not negligible and it is not even a monotonous
function of ˜λ. As a result, one can notice in Fig. 5 that for 110Zr the results of both
methods are very close while in a better bound nucleus of 100Zr they diﬀer more.
It is
interesting to note that for 100Zr and 110Zr the deformation dependence of δEshell is very
similar in both variants of calculations. This is in accord with the observation made in
Ref. [2] that the diﬀerence between the shell corrections obtained in the standard method
and the semiclassical approach depends rather weakly on deformation.

As discussed earlier, two main sources of the error of the standard smoothing procedure
are (i) the error in determining the total single-particle energy, and (ii) the uncertainty of
smoothing that inﬂuences the value of the smooth single-particle energy. Since (i) and (ii)
are not independent, a large cancellation takes place which might reduce the total error.
However, it is a priori diﬃcult to predict how large this diﬀerence is and how strongly it
would aﬀect the predicted position of the drip line.
In order to shed some light on this
question, we carried out a comparison between shell corrections calculated with the two
methods for the spherical Sn and Z=114 isotopes, and for the deformed Zr and Er isotopes.
(In the latter case, we ﬁxed deformation at β2=0.2.) These nuclei represented medium-
mass and heavy nuclei where the generalized shell-correction method can be applied. The
results are presented in Fig. 6. Except for well-bound Zr and Z=114 isotopes, the diﬀerence
between the shell corrections calculated using the old and the new methods are on the order
of MeV, and, except for the Sn isotopes, it is rather large when approaching ˜λ = 0 (drip line).
Although our calculations do not aim at determining the actual position of the drip line, they
give a reasonably good estimate for the uncertainty of the old procedure. If one identiﬁes
the drip line with the neutron number where λ becomes positive (this assumption is usually

9

violated in actual calculations because of the lack of self-consistency between the microscopic
and macroscopic parts of the energy formula [2]), our limited calculations suggest that the
drip-line predictions by the standard method are prone to severe uncontrolled uncertainties.

C. Modiﬁcation of the Green’s Function Method to the Proton Case

In the presence of the long-range Coulomb potential, the free Hamiltonian appearing
in Eq. (14) has to be modiﬁed.
Indeed, for the protons, the asymptotic behavior of the
scattering states is that of the Coulomb functions, not plane waves. Therefore, in this case,
for the free Hamiltonian we take

ˆH0 = ˆT + VCoul,

(20)

with VCoul being the Coulomb potential. The role of the Coulomb term is to eﬀectively push
the continuum up in energy to the top of the Coulomb barrier. The results are insensitive
to the radius of the Coulomb potential in the free Hamiltonian. As a matter of fact, even a
point Coulomb potential can be used in Eq. (20) [26].

Figure 7 shows the smoothed proton level density in the proton-rich nucleus 180Pb. One
can see that already with a rather low value of Nmax=19 the new method reproduces the
exact smoothed level density in the whole range of negative energies, and Nmax=30 gives an
excellent agreement with the exact result. The reason that relatively low values of Nmax are
suﬃcient in the proton case is that even slightly unbound states (narrow proton resonances)
are well localized due to the conﬁning eﬀect of the Coulomb barrier.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we employed the Green’s function oscillator expansion method to calcula-
tions of shell corrections. For spherical nuclei, the new method has proved to be a fast and
very accurate approximation to the exact procedure. It also allows for a straightforward
generalization to deformed shapes. In essence, the method is based on two simultaneous
diagonalizations in a large oscillator basis. The ﬁrst diagonalization involves the actual one-
body Hamiltonian while the other one is carried out for the free Hamiltonian representing
the particle gas whose contribution to the level density should be subtracted. For the neu-
trons, the free Hamiltonian is given by the kinetic energy operator, while for the protons it
also includes the Coulomb potential. In practice, the space of 30 (stretched) oscillator shells
is suﬃcient to guarantee the stability of results. This relatively large (but still tractable)
space is necessary not only for the proper treatment of the free gas but also for the accurate
calculations the total single-particle energy.

As demonstrated in our study, the use of the standard smoothing procedure can lead
to serious deviations when extrapolating oﬀ beta stability. In particular, the particle drip
lines predicted in the traditional approach can be very uncertain. (The systematic error in
δEshell, due to the particle continuum, can be as large as several MeV at the neutron drip
line.) According to our calculations, the error on δEshell depends weakly on deformation in
most cases. It is only for the weakly bound nuclei that the diﬀerence between the old and
new methods exhibits a sizable deformation dependence.

10

There is no simple “ﬁx” that would cure the deﬁciencies of the standard Strutinsky
procedure when applied to ﬁnite-depth potentials. One does need the large basis in order to
guarantee the stability of Es.p.. On the other hand, at these large values of Nmax, the smooth
single-particle energy becomes unreliable due to the unphysical increase of the quasi-bound
levels around the threshold. We believe that the new Green’s function method, together
with the generalized plateau condition, is a very useful tool that should be employed in
future global calculations of nuclear masses in the framework of the one-body (macroscopic-
microscopic) description and in level-density calculations for spherical and deformed nuclei.
Of course, the new procedure does not remove the generic problem of the lack of the self-
consistency condition between the microscopic and macroscopic Fermi energies [2]. Recently,
the Green’s function method, based on self-consistent potentials obtained in Hartree-Fock
and relativistic mean-ﬁeld calculations, was used to extract shell corrections in the spherical
superheavy nuclei [27]. Although these calculations were not done using the oscillator basis
expansion method but directly in the coordinate space, their main principle is the same as
that discussed in this paper.

Abstract

A covariant model based on the Bethe-Salpeter formalism is proposed
for investigating the solar proton burning process pp → De+νe and the
near-threshold deuteron disintegration via electromagnetic and weak inter-

actions. Results of numerical calculations of the energy dependence of rele-

vant cross sections and the astrophysical low-energy cross section factor Spp

of the proton burning process are presented. Our results conﬁrm previous

canonical values, and the energy dependence of the Spp factor is rather close

to phenomenological extrapolations commonly adopted in computations of

solar nuclear reaction rates.

I. Introduction: The proton-proton fusion reaction pp → De+νe plays an impor-
tant role in understanding processes occurring in the Sun and in investigating the solar

structure. This reaction is the ﬁrst step in the chain of nuclear reactions producing the

solar energy and neutrino ﬂuxes. Unfortunately the corresponding cross section is far

too low for a direct laboratory study. In this context reliable theoretical calculations and

estimates of the reaction rates are of a great importance. Nowadays, the most precise

estimates have been obtained within the framework of low-energy potential models [1–4].

The accuracy of the obtained results is believed to be of the order of few per cents or

even better [2,5]. For instance, the low-energy cross section factor Spp that determines
the rates for the proton-proton fusion is estimated as Spp = 4.00(1 ± 0.007) × 10−25 MeV
b [2]. While this number is considered as a canonical value, recent estimates [6], based on

an eﬀective relativistic ﬁeld theory, claimed a considerably larger value being inconsistent

with helioseismic data [7,8]. This has triggered a series of recalculations of Spp within

various approaches (cf. [9–11] and further references therein), which recover values of Spp

centered around the canonical one. However, there are some other indications [12] that
Spp may be 4.2 × 10−25 MeV b or even larger.

Calculations of the pp rates require the evaluation of two main ingredients: (i) the

weak-interaction matrix element, and (ii) the overlap of the pp and deuteron wave func-

tions. In most relativistic eﬀective ﬁeld theories a self-consistent treatment of the deuteron

bound state is diﬃcult, so one usually adopts the short-range eﬀective theory [13] to avoid

an explicit use of the deuteron wave function. Within such models one may achieve good

ﬁts of data in the zero energy limit, whereas a computation of matrix elements at ﬁnite

values of the energy is not yet available.

In this paper we calculate the relevant matrix elements within a fully covariant model

of the deuteron, based on the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) formalism. Within this model a vari-

ety of quantities, including the total and diﬀerential cross sections, energy dependences,

angular distributions etc. are accessible. In the ﬁrst part of this paper we introduce our

formalism and consider as examples the processes of near-threshold deuteron disintegra-

tion by electromagnetic and weak interactions. The second part extends the formalism

and is entirely dedicated to the solar pp burning processes. Within the relativistic impulse

approximation a fully covariant expression for the Spp factor is obtained.

II. Deuteron disintegration near thresholds: In this section we consider processes
of the type lD → l′N1N2, i.e. the deuteron disintegration by leptons in electromagnetic
(eD → e′pn) and weak (e+D → νpp) reactions near threshold. There the amplitudes fall
down rapidly and the cross sections are governed by the phase space of ﬁnal products.

1

The threshold energies are Ethr = 2.7375 MeV (eD reactions) and Ethr = 0.93139 MeV

(weak interaction), where Ethr is the total energy of the incident lepton in the deuteron

rest frame. We consider the electromagnetic disintegration process within the one-photon

exchange approximation (cf. ﬁg. 1a) and the weak positron-nucleon interaction (cf. ﬁg. 1b)
within the eﬀective Fermi model. The deuteron vertex D → NN is treated in a covariant
way within the BS formalism. The BS equation has been solved numerically [14], with

realistic one-boson-exchange interactions, and suitably parameterized [15]. The solution

describes fairly accurate the main low-energy and static characteristics of the deuteron,

such as the deuteron binding energy, and its quadrupole and magnetic moments [16].

The invariant cross section of the process D(l, l′)NN, depicted in ﬁg. 1, has the form

dσ =

(2π)4δ(4) (kl + pD − k′

l − pN1 − pN2)

disregarded, and with high accuracy also the nucleon formfactor F1(Q2) is replaced by

unity. Then the electromagnetic part of the leptonic tensor is computed straightforwardly.

For the weak vertices one may employ the Weinberg-Salam theory for weak interactions,

however, in the considered energy range the eﬀective Fermi model is appropriate. Thus

ˆjµ(x) = ¯ψe(x)γµ (1 − γ5)ψν(x),
ˆJν(x)(∆S=0) = cos θc

where Φ(p0,|p2|) is the covariant generalization of the deuteron wave function [16] within
the BS formalism, which has the following form in the deuteron rest frame

Φ(|p2|) =

GS(p0,|p2|)

and above the weak thresholds, the cross section of positron weak disintegration of the

deuteron seems far too low to be measured under laboratory conditions. So one may

conclude that at present an experimental investigation of the matrix element, relevant

for the solar pp fusion, is still impossible also when using the cross channels. (This is in

contrast to other reactions, cf. [20].) Only reliable theoretical calculations may be applied

to estimate the nuclear reaction rates and to interpret the corresponding experimental

neutrino data.

III. Solar proton burning process: Let us now consider the process of the two-
proton fusion p1 p2 → νe+D at low relative energies. While this reaction looks rather
similar to the processes in the previous section, here appears a peculiarity. Due to the

relation 2mp > Md + µ (with mp = 938.27231 MeV, Md = 1875.61339 MeV, deuteron

binding energy εD = 2.22455 MeV, and µ = 0.510999 MeV) there is no energy threshold

for the pp fusion and, in principle, the fusion process may occur at arbitrarily small relative

energies of the two protons. In this case, in the cross section (1) two factors will play the
major role: (i) the two-proton ﬂux (∼ q

interaction is accounted for only in the Coulomb part of the interaction by adopting

the corresponding part of the above two-proton wave function ψpp. A treatment of the

nuclear part of the proton wave function as plane waves means that in the matrix element

all transitions are allowed. Nevertheless, at low energies only the lowest partial waves

contribute to the proton wave function and one may expect that the total cross section

will be determined by the axial part of the current operator (5) and correspondingly by
the super-allowed 0+ → 0+ Gamov-Teller transition.

In the limit Tpp → 0, apart from the phase space volume, the value of the deuteron
wave function ψ(p0,|p|) at vanishing values of its arguments becomes important. As
can be seen from eq. (8), at |p| → 0, 2Ep → 2m the wave function ψ(p0,|p|) displays
a sharp maximum. Our solution of the BS equation [14] has been obtained by solving

a system of coupled integral equations with Gaussian meshes with a minimum value of
|p| = 0.310848493733 MeV, so that an extrapolation to |p| = 0 needs to be employed.
This procedure causes some numerical uncertainty which we estimate to be about 10% in

the ﬁnal results.

By observing that in the center of mass of colliding protons 2q

a value of 3.960×10−25 MeV b in agreement with previous results [2,5]. At larger energies,
however, the Spp factor increases rather rapidly. The two curves in ﬁg. 4 correspond to

two diﬀerent methods of numerical calculations. In one case the deuteron wave function

is replaced by its value at zero transferred momenta. To some extent this corresponds to

calculations within low-energy eﬀective potential models. The full line reﬂects results of

calculations without such an approximation. Only at relatively high values of the kinetic

energy, Tpp > 20 KeV, the eﬀect of the deuteron wave function becomes sizeable.

Within low-energy eﬀective theories the associated derivatives of the Spp factor play an

important role. The best estimates of the ﬁrst derivative seem to be those quoted in ref.
pp/S = 11.2 MeV−1. In ﬁgs. 5 and 6
we display our estimates for the energy dependence of these derivatives. The derivatives

pp = 4.48 × 10−24 b, and the logarithmic one S ′

[2], S ′

are computed at each value of Tpp by interpolating Spp with a quadratic interpolation

formula. From these pictures it is seen that within our approach both the derivative and
the logarithmic derivative are below the estimates in [2] by ∼ 15 − 20%. However, at
energies around T (0)
pp our results for the Spp factor and the results of an interpolation with

parameters from [2] are rather close to each other.

IV. Summary: We present a covariant model, based on the Bethe-Salpeter formalism,

to investigate the energy dependence of the matrix elements relevant to the solar proton-

proton burning process. Explicit covariant expressions for the cross section and the low-

energy cross section factor Spp are presented. Our numerical estimates of Spp and its

derivatives conﬁrm previous results.

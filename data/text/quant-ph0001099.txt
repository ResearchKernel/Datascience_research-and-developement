Abstract

The object of this paper is to discuss the physical interpretation of quantum behaviour
of Schrodinger electron (SchEl) and bring to light on the cause for the Heisenberg conve-
nient operator way of its describing, using the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics laws and
its mathematical results. We describe the forced stochastically diverse circular harmonic
oscillation motion, created by force of the electrical interaction of the SchEl’s elementary
electric charge (ElmElcChrg) with the electric intensity (ElcInt) of the resultant quan-
tum electromagnetic ﬁeld (QntElcMgnFld) of the existing StchVrtPhtns, as a solution of
Abraham-Lorentz equation. By dint of this equation we obtain that the smooth thin line
of a classical macro particle is rapidly broken of many short and disorderly orientated
lines, owing the continuous dispersion of the quantum micro particle (QntMicrPrt) on the
StchVrtPhtns. Between two successive scattering the centers of diverse circular oscilla-
tions with stochastically various radii are moving along this short disordered line. These
circular harmonic oscillations lie within the ﬂats, perpendicular to same disordered short
line, along which are moving its centers.
In a result of same forced circular harmonic
oscillation motion the smooth thin line of the LrEl is roughly spread and turned out into
some cylindrically wide path of the SchEl. Hence the dispersions of diﬀerent dynamical
parameters, determining the state of the SchEl, which are results of its continuously inter-
action with the resultant QntElcMgnFld of the StchVrtPhtns. The absence of the smooth
thin line trajectory at the circular harmonic oscilation moving of the QntMicrPrt forces
us to use the matrix elements (Fourier components) of its roughly spread wide cylindrical
path for its description.

Introduction

We assume that the vacuum ﬂuctuations (VcmFlcs) through zero-point quantum electromag-
netic ﬁeld (QntElcMgnFld) perform an important role in a behaviour of the micro particles
(MicrPrts). As thing turned out that if the Brownian stochastic motion (BrnStchMtn) of some
classical micro particle (ClsMicrPrt) is a result of ﬂuctuating deviations of averaged values
of all having an eﬀect forces on a ClsMcrPrt, coming from many molecule blows from a sur-
round environment, then the quantized stochastic dualistic wave-particle behaviour of every
QntMicrPrt is a result of the continuous uncontrolled electromagnetic interaction (ElcMgnIn-
tAct) between its well spread (WllSpr) elementary electric charge (ElmElcChrg) of the charged
one (a Schrodinger’s electron (SchEl)) or its magnetic dipole moment (MgnDplMmn) for un-
charged one (as a neutron), and the averaged electric intensity for charged MicrPrts or the

1

averaged magnetic intensity for uncharged one, of the resultant quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld
(QntElcMgnFld) of all stochastic virtual photons (StchVrtPhtns), excited within the FlcVcm
and existing within its neighborhood, which exercises a very power inﬂuence on its state and
behaviour. Consequently the continuously scattering of the well spread (WllSpr) elementary
electric charge (ElmElcChrg) of the SchEl on the StchVrtPhtns at its creation powerfully bro-
ken the smooth thin line of the classical trajectory of many short and very disorderly orien-
tated small lines and the powerfully its interaction (IntAct) with the electric intensity (ElcInt)
or magnetic intensity (MgnInt) of the resultant QntElcMgnFld of the existing StchVrtPhtns
forced it to make the circular harmonic oscillations with various radii and the centers, lying
over the small disordered lines. In a result of this complicated motion the narrow smooth line
of the classical trajectory is turned out into some wide rough cylindrically spread path of the
QntMcrPrt. Although in further we will give the necessary calculations, we wish to repeated,
that as a result of the continuously scattering of the QntMicrPrt on the StchVrtPhtns at their
creations the smooth thin line of the classical trajectory is turned out into powerfully often
broken of many small and very disorderly orientated short lines. The uninterrupted ElcMgn-
IntAct of the ElmElcChrg or of the MgnDplMmn of the QntMicrPrt with the ElcInt or the
MgnInt of the resultant QntElcMgnFld of the StchVrtPhtns, existent within the ﬂuctuating
vacuum (FlcVcm) between two consecutive scatterings forced the QntMicrPrt to carry out
the stochastic circular oscillation motion, which exercise an inﬂuence of its behavior within a
neighborhood of the smooth classically line into the cylindrically spread by diﬀerent radii wide
path. It isn’t allowed us to forget that the broken of the smooth thin line of very short and
very disorderly orientated small line is a result of its continuously scattering on the StchVrt-
Phtns, over which are found the centers of the forced stochastic circular oscillation motion of
the QntMicrPrt, owing a result of the ElcMgnIntAct of its WllSpr ElmElcChrg and MgnD-
plMmn with the intensities of the resultant electric ﬁeld (RslElcFld) and resultant magnetic
ﬁeld (RslMgnFld) of the stochastic virtual photons (StchVrtPhtns). The WllSpd ElmElcChrg
of the SchEl is moving at its circular oscillations of diﬀerent radii within the ﬂats, which are
perpendicular to the very short and very disorderly orientated small lines, obtained in a result
of its continuously scattering on the StchVrtPhtns, at its Furtian quantized stochastic circu-
lar harmonic oscillation motion through the ﬂuctuating vacuum (FlcVcm). Therefore in our
transparent survey about the physical model (PhsMdl) of the nonrelativistic quantized SchrEl
one will be regarded as some WllSpr ElmElcChrg), participating simultaneously in two dif-
ferent motions: A) The classical motion of a classical Lorentz’ electron (LrEl) along an well
contoured smooth thin trajectory, realized in a consequence of some known interaction (In-
tAct) of its over spread (OvrSpr) ElmElcChrg, MgnDplMnt or bare mass with the intensity
of some external classical ﬁelds (ClsFlds) as in the Newton nonrelativistic classical mechan-
ics (NrlClsMch) and Maxwell nonrelativistic classical electrodynamics (ClsElcDnm). B) The
isotropic three-dimensional nonrelativistic quantized (IstThrDmnNrlQnt) Furthian stochastic
boson circular harmonic oscillations motion (FrthStchBsnCrcHrmOscMtn) of the SchEl as a
natural result of the permanent ElcIntAct of its WllSpr ElmElcChrg with the ElcInt of the
resultant QntElcMgnFld of a large number StchVrtPhtns. This ElcIntAct between the WllSpr
ElmElcChrg and the FlcVcm (zero-point ElcMgnFld) is generated by dint of StchVrtPhtns ex-
changed between the ﬂuctuating vacuum (FlcVcm) and the WllSpr ElmElcChrg during a time
interval of their life. As soon as this Furthian quantized stochastic wave-particle behaviour of
the SchEl is very similar to known Brownian classical stochastic behaviour of the ClsMacrPrt,
therefore the QntMicrPrt cannot has the classical sharp contoured smooth and thin trajectory
but has a cylindrical broad rough path, obtained as a sum of circular oscillations motions of

2

diﬀerent radii and centers, lying on accidental broken short lines, strongly disordered within
a space. Hence the often broken trajectory of the moving QntMicrPrt present itself a sum of
small parts from some circumferences with diﬀerent radii and centers, lying within ﬂats, which
are perpendicular to accidental broken short lines, strongly disordered in space. Therefore in
a principle the exact description of the resultant behaviour of the SchEl owing of its joint par-
ticipation in both mentioned above motions could be done only by means of the NrlQntMch’s
and nonrelativistic ClsElcDnm’s laws.

It is known of many scientists the existence of three diﬀerent ways [5], [8] and [9], [7] and [18],
[19] for the description of the quantum behaviour [4] of the nonrelativistic SchEl. It is turned
out that there is some possibility enough to show by means of the existence intrinsic analogy
between the quadratic diﬀerential wave equation in partial derives (QdrDfrWvEqtPrtDrv) of
Schrodinger and the quadratic diﬀerential particle equation in partial derivative (QdrDfrPrtE-
qtPrtDrv) of Hamilton-Jacoby that the addition of the kinetic energy of the Furthian stochastic
boson circular harmonic oscillation of some QntMicrPrt to the kinetic energy of such ClsMacr-
Prt determines their dualistic wave-particle quantized behaviour. It turns out the stochastic
motion over the powerfully break up the sharp contoured smooth thin classical line of the in
many shortly and very disorderly (stochastically orientated) small lines. As in such a natural
way we have ability enough to obtain the minimal value of the dispersion product, determined
with the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. Science there exists an essential analogy between the
registration forms of the quadratic diﬀerential diﬀusive equation (QdrDfrDfsEqt) of Focker-
Plank for the distribution function P (r, t) of a probability density (DstFncPrbDns) of the free
Brownian ClsMacrPrt (BrnClsMacrPrt) in a motionless coordinate system in a respect to it and
quadratic diﬀerential wave equation in partial derivative (QdrDfrWvEqtPrtDrv) of Schrodinger
for the orbital wave function (OrbWvFnc) of some free Furthian QntMicrPrt (FrthQntMicrPrt)
in a motionless coordinate system in a respect to it we come to an essential conclusion that there
are also some possibility enough to describe the quantized stochastic behaviour of the SchEl
by means of the analogy between the classical Wiener continual integral and the quantized
Feynman continual integral. Feynman has used for the description of transition between two
OrbWvFncs of some free FrthQntMicrPrt with diﬀerent coordinates and times some formula,
analogous of such the formula, which early had been used by Einstein [13], [16], Smoluchowski
[14] and Wiener [17] for the description of same transition between two DstFncsPrbDns of the
free BrnClsMacrPrts. In this way we understand why the behaviour of the QntMicrPrt must be
described by the OrbWvFnc Ψ , although the behaviour of the ClsMacrPrt may be described
by a line.

2 Mathematical description of the physical cause ensur-

ing the display of the QntMicrPrt behaviour.

The object of this paper is to discuss the fundamental problems of the physical interpretation
of the nonrelativistic quantized behaviour of the SchEl and bring to light for understanding the
cause,securing the existence of this uncommon state of each the QntMicrPrt. It is necessary to
understand why the QntMicrPrt has no classical smooth thin trajectory and why its behaviour
must be described by the Heisenberg matrix of the convenient operator way, using the laws of
the NrlQntMch and its eﬀective mathematical results. The PhsMdl of the SchEl is built by
means of the equation of the forced motion of the dumping classical oscillator under the force
action of electric interaction (ElcIntAct) between its WllSpr ElmElcChrg and the ElcInt of the

3

RslQntElcMgnFld of the StchVrtPhtns, created in the FlcVcm. The unusual behaviour of the
SchEl may be described by the following motion equation in Maxwell nonrelativistic classical
electrodynamics (ClsElcDnm):

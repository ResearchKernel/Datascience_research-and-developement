Abstract

We calculate cross sections of high energy electron inclusive scattering oﬀ
nuclear matter in a new and consistent formulation based on the Green’s function
method with the Glauber approximation, which is an extension of our previous
′
work on the nuclear transparency in (e, e
p) reaction. The comparison with other
approaches is discussed. In this framework, we study the ﬁnite-range eﬀect of the
nucleon-nucleon interaction in the ﬁnal-state interactions, and the eﬀect of the
nuclear short-range correlation. We propose a zero-range approximation, which
works well when correlation and ﬁnite interaction-range eﬀects are included. It
greatly reduces the numerical work, while maintaining a reasonable accuracy.

1 Introduction

Experimental data on high-energy electron-nucleus inclusive scattering have been ac-
cumulated for a decade [1]. The experiments were mostly done at SLAC, and will be
done at the Jeﬀerson Lab. Also a new facility called MUSES (Multi-Use Experimental
Storage ring) is planned at RIKEN [2]. Precise data will become available with these
facilities and provide us with a way of studying where and how the quark-gluon degrees
of freedom may come into sight.

The process that we study is the (e, e′) inclusive reaction (Fig. 1) in the nucleon

quasi-elastic region, i.e.,

e + A → e′ + N + (A − 1)∗.

e). The momentum transfer is qµ = kµ − k′

(1.1)
The incident electron has a four-momentum, kµ = (ǫ, ke), and the outgoing electron, k′
µ
= (ǫ′, k′
µ = (ω, q). We are interested in the
quasi-elastic region, i.e., |q| ∼ 2 [GeV/c], and ω ≤ 2 [GeV]. So the elementary process
is considered to be mostly the electron-nucleon elastic scattering, e + N → e + N, and
the ﬁnal-state interaction (FSI) of the struck nucleon is what we wish to study here.
In this work we calculate the eﬀect of the FSI, taking into account only the nucleonic
degrees of freedom. We use the Glauber approximation for the FSI, including the
nuclear correlation. We believe that our treatment is a more systematic approach than
the previous works.

The theoretical treatment of this reaction is similar to that we used for the nuclear
transparency in the (e, e′p) reaction at large-momentum transfers [3], [4]. This process
has recently attracted many researchers in connection with a speculated phenomenon
of the color transparency [5]. The present formulation allows us to describe the (e, e′)
and (e, e′p) reactions in a uniﬁed way.

The nuclear transparency for electron scattering can be deﬁned as the ratio of
the (e, e′p) response to the inclusive (e, e′) response in the quasi-elastic region, and is
conveniently formulated by the Green’s function method [6]. We will give here a way
of calculating the response functions based on the Glauber approximation [7] for the
Green’s function, without taking account of the proton internal structure.

The contents of this paper are as follows: In sec. 2 we explain our formulation. We
explain our standpoint about the elementary process, i.e., the electron-nucleon cross
section, in subsec. 2.1. We derive a closed form of the inclusive cross section based on
the Glauber approximation in subsec. 2.2. The deﬁnition of the FSI-function is also
given there. The expression of the response function for nuclear matter is derived in
subsec. 2.3, and the deﬁnition of our “convolution” function is found. We derive the
approximate expressions of the FSI-function when we apply zero-range approximations
for the nucleon-nucleon potential in subsec. 2.4. In sec. 3 we compare our treatment of
the FSI with others. In subsec. 3.1 we discuss the diﬀerence and the relation between
our formulation and the theory of Gersch, Rodriguez, and Smith [8], [9], [10]. A similar
comparison with the optical potential formalism [11], [12] is given in subsec. 3.2. In
sec. 4 we show our numerical results and discuss their indications. We show the FSI-
function in subsec. 4.1, and the inclusive cross sections in subsec. 4.2. We summarize
our results in sec. 5. In the Appendix we show a method for deriving a nucleon-nucleon
potential from the experimental scattering amplitude in the eikonal approximation.

2 Formulation

In this section we explain our formulation of the electron-nucleus inclusive scattering
based on the Green’s function method [6]. We employ the Glauber approximation for
the FSI of the struck nucleon.

2.1 Choice of the eN Cross Section

Let us ﬁrst explain our standpoint about the elementary process of the (e, e′) inclusive
reaction.

We start with the (e, e′) inclusive diﬀerential cross section on a target nucleus, A,

which is assumed to be expressed as [13]

dσeA

far oﬀ-shell, i.e., δm2/m2
N ≃ O(1), in the case (I), while it is not very oﬀ-shell in the
cases (II) and (III). This exercise tells us that one should be careful in choosing the
oﬀ-shell kinematics for the inclusive (e, e′) response. What may be important in the
high-energy inclusive reaction is the oﬀ-shellness of the nucleon in the ﬁnal state, not
in the initial state. This has been stressed previously by, e.g., Uchiyama, et al. [17],
and Cioﬁ and Simula [18].

The oﬀ-shell cross section proposed so far is that of the half-oﬀ-shell [14], [15]. In
the prescription the bound nucleon in the initial state is treated as oﬀ-the-mass shell,
while the nucleon in the ﬁnal state is treated on-the-mass shell. This is reasonable for
the (e, e′p) semi-inclusive reaction, but not for the (e, e′) inclusive. Furthermore, for the
(e, e′) inclusive process the nuclear matter limit (A → ∞) can be taken, while for the
(e, e′p) semi-inclusive process that limit cannot be deﬁned, because the nucleon in the
ﬁnal state cannot be free due to the inﬁnitely extended nuclear matter. Therefore, the
oﬀ-shell cross section, which is presently available, is not suitable for the elementary
process of the (e, e′) inclusive reaction.

We thus choose to avoid using such oﬀ-shell cross sections, and use the on-shell cross
section. This is the basis for our choice of the on-shell kinematics for the initial nucleon.
The construction of the models describing the internal structure of the nucleon and its
interaction with the nuclear medium is beyond the scope of this work, and we use the
simple factorized form with the on-shell form factors.

Therefore the agreement of the numerical results with the experimental data is
not necessarily the aim of this work. In the following we concentrate on a consistent
treatment of the FSI of the struck nucleon in the Green’s function method with the
Glauber approximation.

2.2 Green’s Function Method

We now proceed to the derivation of the closed form of the response function, S(ω, q),
in eq. (2.1) in the Green’s function method with the Glauber approximation. The
response function is deﬁned by

S(ω, q) ≡ XX |hX| ˆO(q)|Ai|2 δ(ω − EX)

1

= −

where r1 is the coordinate of the struck nucleon denoted as 1. We neglect the interfer-
ence eﬀects among diﬀerent nucleons with which the photon couples.

We decompose the full hamiltonian, ˆHA, in eq. (2.4) as

ˆHA = ˆK1 + ˆHA−1 + ˆV1,A−1.

(2.7)

Here ˆK1 is the kinetic-energy operator for the struck nucleon, 1, and ˆHA−1 is the
hamiltonian for the residual nucleus. ˆV1,A−1 is the interaction of the struck nucleon
with other nucleons in the target nucleus, which is assumed to be expressed as a sum
of the two-body interactions, VNN(r),

V1,A−1(r1; r2,· · · , rA) =

AXj=2

VNN(r1 − rj).

(2.8)

For numerical calculations we construct the nucleon-nucleon potential, VNN(r), from
the phenomenological scattering amplitude describing the observed cross sections. The
potential is complex in the energy region where we are interested in. We will leave the
details in the Appendix.

Introducing the Green’s function for the nucleon, 1, interacting with the residual

nucleus in the ﬁxed-scatterer approximation which is given by

G(ω; r1, r′

1; r2, . . . , rA) ≡ hr1|

1

with mN being the nucleon mass, and v = p/Ep. We are free to choose the direction of
the z-axis at this stage, but will take it to be in the direction of q, since the exponential
in the integrand of eq. (2.10) is strongly oscillating in this direction for large-|q|. Here
we have also neglected En, because it is small compared to ω, which is roughly 2 [GeV].
The vectors, r1, r′

1, are thus decomposed as,

1, and r′′

r1 = (b1, z1), r′

1 = (b′

1, z′

1), r′′

1 = (b1, z′′

1 ).

(2.13)

The backward piece in eq. (2.11) becomes important only when we discuss the sum
rule, and will be omitted in the following. Then the imaginary part of the Green’s
function is obtained as

Im G(ω; r1, r′

1; r2,· · · , rA) ≡

1

1)

≃ ρ(r1, r′
× Z dr2 ρ(r2) g(|r′

1 − r2|) g(|r1 − r2|) exp{−

i

where Z ≡ z1−z′
1, and V is the volume of the system. Since we normalize the one-body
density to one, ρ(r) becomes ρ0 ≡ 1/V . The FSI-function, eq. (2.20), is expressed as

1 − r2|) g(|r1 − r2|)

F (Z) = −ρNM Z dr2 g(|r′
× 1 − exp{−

i

2.4 Zero-range Approximations

In this subsection we discuss the zero-range approximations for the nucleon-nucleon
potential, VNN(r), for the FSI-function, eq. (2.20), which are often employed in the
literatures. Within our knowledge, the approximations have never been examined in
the Glauber approach. Here we will study them in two stages within our framework,
and reduce the numerical work greatly.

The ﬁrst one is to make the zero-range approximation only in the z-direction (ZR1).
This approximation amounts to replacing VNN(r) by V⊥(b) δ(z). The b-dependence of
the last factor on the r.h.s. of eq. (2.20) factorizes and we obtain

i

1 − exp{−

The zero-range approximation in the transverse directions implies that f (q) is inde-
pendent of q. Thus eq. (2.32) becomes

2π

Γ(b) ≃

3 Comparison with other Formulations

In the following two subsections, we compare our formulation based on the Glauber
approximation with the theory of Gersch, Rodriguez, and Smith (GRS theory) [8], [9]
and a formulation with the optical potential [11]. For the latter case, we show some
numerical estimates in the next section.

3.1 GRS Theory

In this subsection, we point out the features of the GRS theory [8], [9], and compare
them with those of our formulation by using R(ω, q) deﬁned in eq. (2.5),

R(ω, q) ≡ hA| ˆO†(q)

1

Only ˆV1,A−1 does not commute with ˆp1 · q/m.
R0(ω, q) and R1(ω, q) in eq. (3.3) gives F0(q) and F1(q) of Rinat and Taragin
[10]. They apply the GRS theory to the (e, e′) inclusive reaction for the ﬁrst time. In
their work, after they obtain the expression of F0(q) and F1(q), they exponentiate the
potential term of F1(q) to obtain their ﬁnal expression.

Next, we consider the expansion of R(ω, q) in terms of ˆV1,A−1 in the Glauber theory.

According to the usual perturbation theory we write

1

and ∆2 ¯R0(ω, q) is the correction to the ﬁxed-scatterer approximation deﬁned by

∆2 ¯R0(ω, q) = hA|

1

where W A
µν,IA(q, ω) is the target nuclear tensor in the impulse approximation which
gives the PWIA cross section corresponding to S0(ω, q) in eq. (2.26). F (ω) is the
convolution function expressed as

F (ω − ω′) =

1

4 Numerical Results and Discussion

In this section we will show our numerical results and the discussions.

4.1 “Convolution” Function

To calculate the convolution functions deﬁned by eq. (2.28), we need a speciﬁc form of
the correlation function, g(r). We take the correlation function of the form

g(r) = 1 − c1 e−r2/a2
1,

(4.1)

where c1 = 0.84 [fm], and a1 = 0.7 [fm] (Fig. 3), which roughly simulates that of
Benhar, et al. (Fig. 6 of Ref. [11]). In our ﬁgure we plot g2(r) instead of g(r) in order
to compare it easily with their pair-distribution function, because our g2(r) corresponds
to their g(r) as we discussed at the end of subsec. 3.2. As one can see from those ﬁgures,
the way how our correlation function approaches unity is slightly diﬀerent from theirs.
The diﬀerence in the curvature may cause a nontrivial eﬀect on the cross section. In
this case, we need another Gaussian term in eq. (4.1). Since what we would like to see
is the diﬀerence coming from diﬀerent manipulations for the FSI and the correlation,
we believe that our choice of the correlation function causes no big problem.

One more thing which we should comment on is the normalization of the wave
function. For the case of a ﬁnite nucleus, we should be very careful for the normalization
including the eﬀect of the nuclear correlation [25]. Fortunately the correction should
be the order of 1/A, which can be neglected for nuclear matter.

By using eq. (4.1), the approximate expressions for F (b1; z1, z′

1), eqs. (2.30) and
(2.34), can be calculated explicitly for nuclear matter. The expression for ZR1, eq. (2.30),
where the zero-range approximation is applied only in the z-direction, becomes

FZR1(Z) ≡ FZR1(b1; z1, z′
1)
= −ρNM Z db2Z z1
= −ρNM

f (0)

z ′
1

dz2 g(|r′

1 − r2|) g(|r1 − r2|) Γ(b1 − b2)

(4.2)

The expression for ZR2 where the zero-range approximation is applied in the whole

direction, eq. (2.34), becomes

FZR2(Z) ≡ FZR2(b1; z1, z′
1)

2π

= −

The ﬁrst term of this expression is the leading term for large-Z. This term is the same
as that of FR of eq. (4.6). Therefore, ZR1’ and FR should show the same large-Z
behavior.

The numerical results for the convolution functions are shown in Figs. 4 a)-c). In

Figs. 4a) and b) we plot

Re ζ(Z) = exp{Re F (Z)} cos (Im F (Z)) ,

(4.9)

because this form appears in eq. (2.25) for p = q, and it carries full information on
FSI. In Fig. 4a) the results with the nuclear correlation are shown. The important
ﬁnding here is that the slope of FR at Z = 0 is the same as that of ZR1. This implies
that the ZR1 can be a good approximation of the ﬁnite-range interaction case even for
small-Z. Since we consider ZR1 as a good approximation of FR for large-Z, we expect
it to be so for the whole range of Z. ZR2 shows a similar behavior to ZR1 in large-Z
region, but in small-Z region ZR2 behaves diﬀerently from ZR1. Thus ZR2 cannot
be expected to be generally applicable. ZR1’ shows the same behavior as FR in the
large-Z region, and slightly diﬀerent in the small-Z. This is what we expected for the
small-Z expansion and thus justiﬁes our expectation that ZR1 is a good approximation
for the whole region.

In Fig. 4b) the results without the nuclear correlation are shown. ZR1 and ZR2
degenerate as one sees from eqs. (4.2) and (4.5), and they show diﬀerent behavior from
FR even in small-Z. From those results, we realize that the nuclear correlation makes
the zero-range approximations better. The nuclear correlation plays an important role
in this context.

In order to compare our formulation with that of the optical potential [11], we
make the Fourier transform of our convolution function, ζ(Z), because their results
were shown as a function of ω,

1

eζ(ω) ≡

which corresponds to the case of Im F (t) = 0 in eq. (4.10), and is the same form
as eq. (3.16), i.e., the correlated Glauber formulation of Ref. [11]. We use eq. (3.17)
for W (q, t) with our parameter set, and g(r) in eq. (3.17) is replaced our correlation
function, {g(r)}2 of eq. (4.1). Therefore, the following expression of W (q, t) is not
completely the same as that of Ref. [11]:

1

W (q, t) ≡

The resulting momentum distribution is shown in Fig. 5. For comparison, we plot the
momentum distribution of the Fermi gas, W (k) = W0 θ(kF − k). The tail shows a
reﬂection of the nuclear correlation.
The numerical result for the one-body density matrix obtained from eq. (4.13) is
shown in Fig. 6. For comparison, we plot that of the Fermi-gas model, which takes the
form [26],

ρ(r, r′) = ρ0

3j1(kF R)

in this work. The problems are interesting and important, but we leave the study for
our future work.

In high-ω region, the experimental data highly exceeds our results, because the
inelastic channel of the eN cross section takes part in the data. To describe the cross
section in such a high-ω region is out of our scope of this work.

5 Summary and Conclusion

We have given here a method to deal with the FSI in the high-energy (e, e′) inclusive
scattering. Since we are interested in the quasi-elastic region, the relevant degrees of
freedom are the nucleonic ones. We have applied the Green’s function method, and
used the Glauber approximation for the FSI. An advantage of this formulation is that
the ﬁnite-range eﬀect of the nucleon-nucleon interaction and the nuclear correlation
are included in a systematical way.

Though the method allows us to express the FSI eﬀect in a closed form, the full
calculation still requires a large amount of numerical works. We have thus examined two
kinds of zero-range approximations for the nucleon-nucleon interaction, which greatly
simplify the integrals involved in the closed form. The one called ZR1, which uses
the zero-range approximation only in the longitudinal direction, has been found to be
accurate enough for the actual calculations.

The method has then been compared with the treatments of the FSI in the other
approaches to the response functions such as that of Gersch, Rodrigues and Smith,
which has been applied to the (e, e′) process in Ref. [10], and the optical-potential
approach used in Ref. [11].

Our principal objective is to propose a uniﬁed framework of calculating the inclusive
(e, e′) and the semi-inclusive (e, e′p) responses with the particular emphasis on the
treatment of the FSI. The results of calculation in the present formalism (ZR1) for the
(e, e′) cross section oﬀ nuclear matter show strong eﬀects of the FSI especially in the
low energy transfer (ω) region qualitatively similar to those observed in Ref. [11]. The
calculated cross section overestimates the experimental one by a factor of about 2 in
the peak region and by larger factors in the low-ω region. This would be partly due to
our simple choice of on-shell kinematics for the eN elastic cross section. We have not
discussed the diﬃcult problem of constructing the oﬀ-shell cross section, which would
be required if we were to make a serious comparison with the observed (e, e′) response.
Instead, we have simply pointed out that, in the inclusive processes, the ﬁnal nucleon
is much more oﬀ-shell than the initial one. Further studies on the in-medium cross
section including the oﬀ-shell kinematics are necessary to draw deﬁnitive conclusions
on the FSI in connection with the color transparency.

We should critically comment here the approximations which we used in this work.
We have relied on several approximations, whose validation needs further and extensive
work. One approximation is that the total disregard of En of the residual nucleus,
which we have used it to obtain the response function, eq. (2.10). We believe it is
good though we have no quantitative basis for it. The other approximation is to our
choice of the form, eq. (2.16), for the A-body density matrix, which is claimed to
represent a reasonable approximation for the calculation of the nuclear transparency.
However it might be inadequate for the calculation of the low-energy-transfer region of
the inclusive cross section. These approximations need to be investigated carefully for
their quantitative validity.

APPENDIX

A Nucleon-Nucleon Potential

In this appendix, we explain how we construct the NN potential phenomenologically.
This is an extension of the method introduced in Ref. [4].

We deal with a two-body scattering in free space. p is a momentum of the incident
proton, p′ is that of the outgoing proton, and the momentum transfer q = p − p′.
Please do not confuse them with the notation of the main part of this paper. In the
following we focus on a kinematic region where p · q ≃ 0.

The scattering amplitude is deﬁned by

f (q) ≡

i|p|

Following the original paper of Glauber [7], we obtain the potential by using the

Abel integral equation through eq. (A.6),

VNN(r) =

The dash-dotted line is the case (III), where V = −50 [MeV], S = 0 [MeV]. The sum,
S + V , is kept to be the same.

Figure 3
Nuclear correlation function, g2(r), of eq. (4.1) as a function of r.

Figure 4 a)
Comparison of the two zero-range approximations for the nuclear matter with the nu-
clear correlation. Real part of our “convolution” function, ζ(Z), of eq. (2.28) is plotted
as a function of Z (= z1 − z′
1). The solid curve is ZR1, eq. (4.2), and the dashed curve
is ZR2, eq. (4.5). For reference, we plot ZR1’, eq. (4.9), by the dot-dashed curve, and
FR, eq. (4.6), for a limited range of Z, by the dotted curve.

Figure 4 b)
Comparison of the two zero-range approximations for the nuclear matter without the
nuclear correlation. The two are indistinguishable in the ﬁgure. The meaning of the
curves is the same as Fig.4 a).

Figure 4 c)
Comparison of the two zero-range approximations for the nuclear matter with the nu-

is plotted as a function of ω. The solid curve is ZR1, eq. (4.2), and the dashed curve
is ZR2, eq. (4.5). For reference, we plot ZR2 without the real part of VNN(r) by the

clear correlation. Fourier transform of our “convolution” function, eζ(Z), of eq. (4.10)
dot-dashed curve, and the one based on the optical potential, eζOP(ω) of eq. (4.11), by

the dotted curve.

Figure 5
Momentum distributions of a nucleon in the nuclear matter as a function of k [fm−1].
W (k) ≡ (2π)3 n0(k). The solid curve is the result of the ﬁtting, eq. (4.14), and the
dotted line is the case of the Fermi gas. The crosses are the data points from Refs. [27],
[28].

Figure 6
One-body density matrix of the nuclear matter as a function of |r− r′|. The solid curve
is the case including the nuclear correlation. The dashed curve is that of the Fermi

27

gas.

Figure 7 a)
The cross sections of the inclusive scattering oﬀ nuclear matter. The dotted curve is
the case of PWIA. The dash-dotted curve is the case of only the FSI (no correlation
eﬀect). The solid curve and the dashed curve are the full calculation including both
the FSI and the nuclear correlation with zero-range approximations. The solid curve is
ZR1, the zero-range approximation in z-direction only. The dashed curve is ZR2, the
zero-range approximation in the whole direction.

Figure 7 b)
Comparison of the cross sections for the cases of ZR1, ZR2, and no correlation with
(the solid curve) or without the real part of VNN(r) (the dashed curve).

Figure 7 c)
Comparison of the numerical result of the cross section and the experimental data [1].
The solid curve is the case of ZR1 ×0.4.
Figure 8
Nucleon-nucleon potential, eq. (A.10), as a function of r for the case of |p| = 2.0
[GeV/c], and γ = 3.37 [(GeV/c)−2]. The dashed curve is the real part, and the solid
curve is the imaginary part.

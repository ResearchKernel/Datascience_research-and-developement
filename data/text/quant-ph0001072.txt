We analyze systematic (classical) and fundamental (quan-
tum) limitations of the sensitivity of optical magnetometers
resulting from ac-Stark shifts. We show that in contrast to
absorption-based techniques, the signal reduction associated
with classical broadening can be compensated in magnetome-
ters based on phase measurements using electromagnetically
induced transparency (EIT). However due to ac-Stark asso-
ciated quantum noise the signal-to-noise ratio of EIT-based
magnetometers attains a maximum value at a certain laser in-
tensity. This value is independent on the quantum statistics
of the light and deﬁnes a standard quantum limit of sensitiv-
ity. We demonstrate that an EIT-based optical magnetome-
ter in Faraday conﬁguration is the best candidate to achieve
the highest sensitivity of magnetic ﬁeld detection and give a
detailed analysis of such a device.

I. INTRODUCTION

The detection of magnetic ﬁelds by optical means is a
well developed technique with applications ranging from
geology and medicine [1] to fundamental tests of viola-
tions of parity and time-reversal symmetry [2].

In spite of their great variety, optical magnetometers
can be divided in two basic classes.
In the ﬁrst class
light absorption at a magnetic resonance is used to de-
tect Zeeman level shifts, while the second class makes use
of the associated changes of the index of refraction. So
called optical pumping magnetometer (OPM) [1] as well
as dark-state magnetometers based on absorption mea-
surements [3] belong to the ﬁrst class. The recently de-
veloped magnetometers based on phase-coherent atomic
media [4,5] and the mean-ﬁeld laser magnetometer of ref.
[6] belong to the second class.

If systematic measurement errors can be avoided,
which in practice can be a challenging task, the smallest
detectable Zeeman shift (in units of frequency) is deter-
mined by the ratio of the noise level of the signal S to its
rate of change with respect to frequency

sensitivity by means of non-classical light ﬁelds and show
that the maximum sensitivity is essentially independent
of the light statistics.

The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we dis-
cuss the fundamental broadening mechanisms of mag-
netic resonances, power-broadening and ac-Stark associ-
ated broadenings. It is shown in Sec. III that the classical
signal reduction due to these broadenings can be compen-
sated in phase-sensitive EIT magnetometers in contrast
to absorption-based techniques.
In Sec. IV fundamen-
tal quantum noise sources are discussed and the stan-
dard quantum limit of magnetometer sensitivity derived.
A detailed analysis of an EIT-Faraday magnetometer is
given in Sec. V and the prospects of using non-classical
input states are discussed.

II. BROADENING OF MAGNETIC

RESONANCES

Optical magnetometers measure in essence the position
of certain resonances which are sensitive to magnetic level
shifts. An important quantity that determines the signal
strength of such a measurement is the width of the mag-
netic resonance. As a rule the narrower the resonance,
the easier it is to detect level shifts.

Magnetic resonances with small natural width can be
obtained e.g. by coupling Zeeman or hyperﬁne compo-
nents of ground states in atoms either with an RF ﬁeld
or via an optical Raman transition. In an optical mag-
netometer these ground-state sub-levels are then coupled
by laser ﬁelds to excited atomic states. The optical cou-
pling is also used to detect energy shifts of the ground-
state sub-levels induced by a magnetic ﬁeld. However,
at the same time this coupling leads to a broadening of
the magnetic resonances via two mechanisms: (i) power-
broadening and (ii) broadening due to ac-Stark shifts.

A. Power-broadening

The ﬁrst mechanism is power-broadening due to the
resonant interaction with the probe transition. When
the Rabi-frequency Ω of the optical probe ﬁeld exceeds
the value

III. COMPENSATION OF BROADENING

EFFECTS IN EIT MAGNETOMETER

We here demonstrate that the classical broadening
mechanisms discussed in the previous section do not nec-
essarily lead to a reduction of the magnetometer signal
if phase measurement techniques are used. It has been
shown in detail in [5] and [8], that power-broadening can
be completely compensated in a phase measurement by
making use of EIT in optically dense Λ-type systems.

The 3-level Λ conﬁguration of an EIT magnetometer as
well as the associated linear susceptibility spectrum of the
probe ﬁeld are shown in Fig.1. Here and in the following
we consider closed systems i.e. we assume that there
are no eﬀective decay mechanism due to time-of-ﬂight
limitations. The upper level of the probe-ﬁeld transition
|ai ↔ |bi is coupled to a meta-stable lower level |ci by a
coherent and strong driving ﬁeld of Rabi-frequency Ωd.
The probe ﬁeld Rabi-frequency is denoted as Ωp (Ωp ≪
Ωd) and the coherence decay rate of the probe transition
as γ. ∆ is the one-photon detuning of the drive ﬁeld
and δ the two-photon detuning. The transverse decay
rate of the two-photon resonance (magnetic resonance)
is denoted as γ0. It is assumed that the corresponding
population exchange between the ground-state sub-levels
is small and will be neglected

As in the case of an OPM there is power-broadening

in an EIT magnetometer as soon as |Ωd| > √

One recognizes, that the sensitivity of phase measure-
ments to Zeeman shifts is determined by the dispersion-

The limit for the smallest detectable Zeeman shift is

therefore given by

absorption ratio (cid:0)1/χ′′(cid:1) dχ′/dω.
∆ωB(cid:12)(cid:12)min =(cid:20) 1

In the usual conﬁguration only the x-polarized com-
ponent of the input ﬁeld is excited and we will restrict
the discussion to a vacuum input of the y-polarized
component. The propagation of the ﬁeld through the
magneto-optical medium is most conveniently described
in terms of right and left circular components E± =

Mach-Zehnder interferometer can approach the so-called
Heisenberg limit ∆φ ≃ 1/hni, where hni is the total num-
ber of registered quanta [15,16].
However, in the presence of losses resulting from the
resonant coupling the noise compensation by means of
non-classical light is only partial due to unwanted noises
added by the medium. Taking into account linear losses
and assuming, that the entrance ﬁeld is squeezed in the
way discussed above, we can rewrite the equation for the
residual noises in the phase as follows:

[11] Although there is no rigorous deﬁnition of a hermitian
phase operator, we nevertheless use it here noting that
we restrict ourselves to states of the radiation ﬁeld which
have no signiﬁcant overlap with the vacuum. In this case
phase and photon number operators nearly coincide with
the phase and amplitude quadrature operators.

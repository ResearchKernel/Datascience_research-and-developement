http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00863v1,"Searching for distinctive signatures, which characterize different formation
channels of binary black holes (BBHs), is a crucial step towards the
interpretation of current and future gravitational wave detections. Here, we
investigate the demography of merging BBHs in young star clusters (SCs), which
are the nursery of massive stars. We performed $4\times{} 10^3$ N-body
simulations of SCs with metallicity $Z=0.002$, initial binary fraction $0.4$
and fractal initial conditions, to mimic the clumpiness of star forming
regions. Our simulations include a novel population-synthesis approach based on
the code MOBSE. We find that SC dynamics does not affect the merger rate
significantly, but leaves a strong fingerprint on the properties of merging
BBHs. More than 50 % of merging BBHs in young SCs form by dynamical exchanges
in the first few Myr. Dynamically formed merging BBHs are significantly heavier
than merging BBHs in isolated binaries: merging BBHs with total mass up to
$\sim{}120$ M$_\odot$ form in young SCs, while the maximum total mass of
merging BBHs in isolated binaries with the same metallicity is only $\sim{}70$
M$_\odot$. Merging BBHs born via dynamical exchanges tend to have smaller mass
ratios than BBHs in isolated binaries. Furthermore, SC dynamics speeds up the
merger: the delay time between star formation and coalescence is significantly
shorter in young SCs. In our simulations, massive systems such as GW170729 form
only via dynamical exchanges. Finally $\sim{}2$ % of merging BBHs in young SCs
have mass in the pair-instability mass gap ($\sim{}60-120$ M$_\odot$). This
represents a unique fingerprint of merging BBHs in SCs.","astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.SR",1901.00863v1,Francesco Haardt,"Ugo N.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00864v1,"Star formation is observed to be strongly correlated to dense regions of
molecular gas. Although the exact nature of the link between star formation and
molecular hydrogen is still unclear, some have suggested that shielding of
dense gas by dust grains is the key factor enabling the presence of both. We
present a sub-grid model for use in galaxy formation simulations in which star
formation is linked explicitly to local dust shielding. We developed and tested
our shielding and star formation models using smoothed particle hydrodynamic
simulations of solar and sub-solar metallicity isolated Milky Way-mass disk
galaxies. We compared our dust shielding-based star formation model to two
other star formation recipes that used gas temperature and H$_2$ fraction as
star formation criteria. We further followed the evolution of a dwarf galaxy
within a cosmological context using both the shielding and H$_2$-based star
formation models. We find that the shielding-based model allows for star
formation at higher temperatures and lower densities than a model in which star
formation is tied directly to H$_2$ abundance, as requiring H$_2$ formation
leads the gas to undergo additional gravitational collapse before star
formation. However, the resulting galaxies are very similar for both the
shielding and H$_2$-based star formation models, and both models reproduce the
resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt law. Therefore, both star formation models appear
viable in the context of galaxy formation simulations.",astro-ph.GA,1901.00864v1,Tom Quinn (University of Washington),"Lindsey Byrne, Charlotte Christensen, Marios Tsekitsidis, Alyson Brooks, Tom Quinn","13 pages, 12 figures",2019-01-07 20:03:14,No journal ref found,Tom Quinn (University of Washington),http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00864v1,astro-ph.GA,2019-01-03T19:00:00Z,Implementing Dust Shielding as a Criteria for Star Formation,2019-01-07 20:03:14
http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00865v1,"We study the properties of the local transverse deviations of magnetic field
lines at a fixed moment in time. Those deviations ""evolve"" smoothly in a plane
normal to the field-line direction as one moves that plane along the field
line. Since the evolution can be described by a planar flow in the normal
plane, we derive most of our results in the context of a toy model for planar
fluid flow. We then generalize our results to include the effects of field-line
curvature. We show that the type of flow is determined by the two non-zero
eigenvalues of the gradient of the normalized magnetic field. The eigenvalue
difference quantifies the local rate of squeezing or coiling of neighboring
field lines, which we relate to standard notions of fluid vorticity and shear.
The resulting squeezing rate can be used in the detection of null points,
hyperbolic flux tubes and current sheets. Once integrated along field lines,
that rate gives a squeeze factor, which is an approximation to the squashing
factor, which is usually employed in locating quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs),
which are possible sites for magnetic reconnection. Unlike the squeeze factor,
the squashing factor can miss QSLs for which field lines are squeezed and then
unsqueezed. In that regard, the squeeze factor is a better proxy for locating
QSLs than the squashing factor. In another application of our analysis, we
construct an approximation to the local rate of twist of neighboring field
lines, which we refer to as the coiling rate. That rate can be integrated along
a field line to give a coiling number, $\mathrm{N_c}$. We show that unlike the
standard local twist number, $\mathrm{N_c}$ gives an unbiased approximation to
the number of twists neighboring field lines make around one another.
$\mathrm{N_c}$ can be useful for the study of flux rope instabilities, such as
the kink instability, and can be used in the detection of flux ropes.","astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.HE",1901.00865v1,Antonia Savcheva,"Svetlin Tassev, Antonia Savcheva","48 pages, 6 figures",2019-01-07 20:03:16,No journal ref found,Antonia Savcheva,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00865v1,astro-ph.SR,2019-01-03T19:00:00Z,"Coiling and Squeezing: Properties of the Local Transverse Deviations of

http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00866v1,"SDSS-IV MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory) is the
largest integral-field spectroscopy survey to date, aiming to observe a
statistically representative sample of 10,000 low-redshift galaxies. In this
paper we study the reliability of the emission-line fluxes and kinematic
properties derived by the MaNGA Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP). We describe the
algorithmic choices made in the DAP with regards to measuring emission-line
properties, and the effect of our adopted strategy of simultaneously fitting
the continuum and line emission. The effect of random errors are quantified by
studying various fit-quality metrics, idealized recovery simulations and repeat
observations. This analysis demonstrates that the emission lines are well-fit
in the vast majority of the MaNGA dataset and the derived fluxes and errors are
statistically robust. The systematic uncertainty on emission-line properties
introduced by the choice of continuum templates is also discussed. In
particular, we test the effect of using different stellar libraries and simple
stellar-population models on the derived emission-line fluxes and the effect of
introducing different tying prescriptions for the emission-line kinematics. We
show that these effects can generate large ($>$ 0.2 dex) discrepancies at low
signal-to-noise and for lines with low equivalent width (EW); however, the
combined effect is noticeable even for H$\alpha$ EW $>$ 6~\AA. We provide
suggestions for optimal use of the data provided by SDSS data release 15 and

Molecular Zone, which fuels star formation, accretion onto the central
super-massive black hole, and large-scale outflows. This inflow happens mostly
through two symmetrical dust-lanes, similar to those often seen in external
barred galaxies. Here we use the fact that the Milky Way dust-lanes have been
previously identified in $^{12}$CO datacubes and a simple geometrical model to
derive the first observational determination of the mass inflow rate into the
Central Molecular Zone. We find that the time-averaged inflow rate along the
near-side dust lane is $1.2^{+0.7}_{-0.8}\, \rm M_\odot yr^{-1}$ and along the
far-side dust lane is $1.5^{+0.9}_{-1.0}\, \rm M_\odot yr^{-1}$, which gives a
total inflow of $2.7^{+1.5}_{-1.7}\, \rm M_\odot yr^{-1}$. We also provide the

http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00868v1,"The neutron star merger, GW170817, was followed by an optical-infrared
transient (a kilonova) which indicated that a substantial ejection of mass at
trans-relativistic velocities occurred during the merger. Modeling of the
kilonova is able to constrain the kinetic energy of the ejecta and its
characteristic velocity, but not the high-velocity distribution of the ejecta.
Yet, this distribution contains crucial information on the merger dynamics. In
this work, we assume a power-law distribution of the form
$E(>\beta\Gamma)\propto(\beta\Gamma)^{-\alpha}$ for the energy of the kilonova
ejecta and calculate the non-thermal signatures produced by the interaction of
the ejecta with the ambient gas. We find that ejecta with minimum velocity
$\beta_0\simeq 0.3$ and energy $E\sim 10^{51}$ erg, as inferred from kilonova
modeling, has a detectable radio, and possibly X-ray, afterglow for a broad
range of parameter space. This afterglow component is expected to dominate the
observed emission on a timescale of a few years post merger and peak around a
decade later. Its light curve can be used to determine properties of the
kilonova ejecta and in particular the ejecta velocity distribution $\alpha$,
the minimum velocity $\beta_0$ and its total kinetic energy $E$. We also
predict that an afterglow rebrightening, that is associated with the kilonova
component, will be accompanied by a shift of the centroid of the radio source

deficient (called Type Ic SNe), broad-lined Type Ic SNe (SNe Ic-bl) are very
energetic events, and all SNe coincident with bona fide long duration gamma-ray
bursts (LGRBs) are of Type Ic-bl. Understanding the progenitors and the
mechanism driving SN Ic-bl explosions vs those of their SNe Ic cousins is key
to understanding the SN-GRB relationship and jet production in massive stars.
Here we present the largest set of host-galaxy spectra of 28 SNe Ic and 14 SN
Ic-bl, all discovered before 2013 by the same untargeted survey, namely the
Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). We carefully measure their gas-phase
metallicities, stellar masses (M*s) and star-formation rates (SFRs) by taking
into account recent progress in the metallicity field and propagating
uncertainties correctly. We further re-analyze the hosts of 10 literature
SN-GRBs using the same methods and compare them to our PTF SN hosts with the
goal of constraining their progenitors from their local environments by
conducting a thorough statistical comparison, including upper limits. We find
that the metallicities, SFRs and M*s of our PTF SN Ic-bl hosts are
statistically comparable to those of SN-GRBs, but significantly lower than
those of the PTF SNe Ic. The mass-metallicity relations as defined by the SNe
Ic-bl and SN-GRBs are not significantly different from the same relations as
defined by the SDSS galaxies, in contrast to claims by earlier works. Our
findings point towards low metallicity as a crucial ingredient for SN Ic-bl and
SN-GRB production since we are able to break the degeneracy between high SFR
and low metallicity. We suggest that the PTF SNe Ic-bl may have produced jets
that were choked inside the star or were able break out of the star as unseen

optical light curves, and compare their utility for comparing flare activity
between stars of differing ages and luminosities. These metrics include: the
fractional luminosity emitted in flares, the specific rate of flares emitted at
a given energy, and a model for the entire flare frequency distribution. With
all three approaches we find that flare activity decreases for all low-mass
stars as they spin-down, and thus with age. Most striking is the evolution of
the flare occurrence frequency distributions, which show no significant change
in the power law slope with age. Since our sample is preferentially constructed
of younger, more active stars, our model over-predicts the super-flare rate
previously estimated for the Sun. Finally, we parameterize our best-fit model
of the flare frequency distribution for ease in predicting the rates of flares
and their associated impacts on planet habitability and detection.",astro-ph.SR,1901.00890v1,Suzanne L. Hawley,"James R. A. Davenport, Kevin R. Covey, Riley W. Clarke, Austin C.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00900v1,"We confirm that the number of globular clusters (GC) N$_{GC}$ is an excellent
tracer of their host's dark halo virial mass M$_{vir}$. The simple linear
relation M$_{vir} = 5 \times 10^9$ M$_{\odot} \times$ N$_{GC}$ fits the data
perfectly from M$_{vir} = 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ to M$_{vir} = 2 \times 10^{15}$
M$_{\odot}$. This result is independent of galaxy morphology and even extends
statistically into the dwarf galaxy regime with M$_{vir} = 10^8 - 10^{10}$
M$_{\odot}$. As this correlation does not depend on GC mass it is ideally
suited for high-precision determinations of M$_{vir}$. The linearity is most
simply explained as a result of hierarchical cosmological merging of a
high-redshift halo seed population that hosted on average one GC per $5 \times
10^9$ M$_{\odot} \times (1- \eta_{smooth})$ of dark matter mass. Here
$\eta_{smooth} \approx 0.9$ denotes the fraction of the present-day dark halo
mass that was accumulated by smooth accretion. Strong secular evolution of the
GC system requires significant fine-tuning as processes like GC disruption
generate non-linear correlations that are not observed. The cosmological
merging scenario also implies a strong decline of the scatter in $N_{GC}$ with
increasing virial mass $\delta N_{GC}/N_{GC} \sim M_{vir}^{-1/2}$ in contrast
with the observations that show a roughly constant scatter, independent of
virial mass. This discrepancy can be explained if errors in determining virial
masses from kinematical tracers and gravitational lensing are of the order of a
factor of 2. GCs in dwarf satellite galaxies pose a serious problem for
high-redshift GC formation scenarios. The dark halo masses of dwarf galaxies
hosting GCs therefore might have been one order of magnitude larger than
currently estimated.",astro-ph.GA,1901.00900v1,Duncan Forbes,"Andreas Burkert, Duncan Forbes","7 pages, 3 figures, submitted to MNRAS",2019-01-07 20:03:41,No journal ref found,Duncan Forbes,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00900v1,astro-ph.GA,2019-01-03T20:10:15Z,"High-Precision Dark Halo Virial Masses from Globular Cluster Numbers:

GeV energy range that was detected by AGILE. The observed emission at >160 MeV
indicates that the radiating electrons had energies above the classical
synchrotron radiation-reaction limit, thus presenting a serious challenge to
classical models for electron acceleration in astrophysical environments. In
this paper, we apply our recently developed time-dependent self-similar
analytical model describing electrostatic acceleration in the explosive
reconnection region around the pulsar wind termination shock to the 2007
September flare. This event was unique in that it displayed both long-duration

makes this flare an especially interesting test for our model. We demonstrate
that our model can reproduce the time-dependent gamma-ray spectrum for this

the spectrum for photon energies >100 MeV. This establishes that our
time-dependent electrostatic acceleration model can explain both wave and
sub-flare transients, which lends further support to the theoretical framework
we have developed. We also further examine the validity of the self-similar
electric and magnetic field evolution implied by our model. We conclude that

reshaped by an exterior slow AGB wind and that nicely fits the basic shape,
kinematics, mass, and momenta of this class of prePNe. Next we vary the most
influential parameters of this ""baseline"" model-such as density, speed, and

injected considerably faster than the lobe expansion speed. Multi-polar and

instabilites corrugate their leading edges. We show how the common linear
relationship of Doppler shift and position along the lobe is a robust outcome
the interaction of tapered diverging streamlines with the lobes' curved walls.
Finally we probe how magnetic fields affect the basline model by adding a
toroidal field to the injected baseline flow. Examples of prePNe and PNe that

behaviour for the lighter species arises from the exchange interaction, while
the heavier species remain spectators. This plasma, which is abelian,

surface temperature and interior temperature. This relation is determined by
the composition of the neutron star envelope and can be affected by the process
of diffusive nuclear burning (DNB), which occurs when elements diffuse to
depths where the density and temperature are sufficiently high to ignite
nuclear burning. We calculate models of H-He and He-C envelopes that include
DNB and obtain analytic temperature relations that can be used in neutron star

this work, we investigate whether the synchrotron maser emission from
relativistic shocks can explain the observed FRB properties. We perform one
dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of perpendicular shocks
propagating in the magnetar wind, assumed to be a cold electron-positron
plasma. We confirm that a linearly polarized X-mode wave is self-consistently
generated by the shock and propagates back upstream as a precursor wave. We
investigate how its efficiency and spectrum depend on the flow magnetization
$\sigma$ (i.e., the ratio of Poynting flux to particle energy flux of the
pre-shock flow), in the regime $\sigma\gtrsim0.1$ relevant for magnetar winds.
Our results are checked for consistency among three PIC codes. We find that at
$\sigma\gtrsim 1$ the shock converts a fraction $ f_\xi \approx 2 \times
10^{-3}/\sigma$ of the total incoming energy into the precursor wave, as
measured in the post-shock frame (in the shock frame, the efficiency is $f_\xi'
\approx 7 \times 10^{-4}/\sigma^2$). The spectrum of the precursor wave is
narrow-band, $\Delta \omega /\omega_{\rm peak} \lesssim 1-3$, with apparent but
not dominant line-like features as many resonances concurrently contribute. The
peak frequency scales in the post-shock frame as $\omega_{\rm peak} \simeq 3\,
\omega_{\rm p}\max[1,\sqrt{\sigma}]$, where $\omega_{\rm p}$ is the plasma
frequency. At $\sigma\gtrsim1$, where our estimated $\omega_{\rm peak}$ differs
from previous works, we find that the shock structure presents two solitons
separated by a cavity, and the peak frequency corresponds to an eigenmode of
the cavity. We also find that the precursor efficiency and spectrum do not
depend on the flow Lorentz factor. Our results provide physically-grounded

the universe obeying a single fluid whose pressure evolves through a

consequences by integrating the speed of sound to obtain the pressure in terms
of the density, leading to an extended version of the Anton-Schmidt cosmic

Anton-Schmidt pressure in the infrared regime. The low-energy case becomes
relevant for the universe to accelerate without any cosmological constant. We
therefore derive the effective representation of our fluid in terms of a
Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}(X)$, depending on the kinetic term $X$
only. We analyze both the relativistic and non-relativistic limits. In the
non-relativistic limit we construct both the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian in
terms of density $\rho$ and scalar field $\vartheta$, whereas in the
relativistic case no analytical expression for the Lagrangian can be found.
Thus, we obtain the potential as a function of $\rho$, under the hypothesis of
irrotational perfect fluid. We demonstrate that the model represents a natural
generalization of \emph{logotropic dark energy models}. Finally, we analyze an

dynamics of the cosmological model and the underlying theory of gravity. At the
linear level of these structures, certain degeneracies remain between different
cosmological models and alternative gravity theories. It is thus indispensable
to study the non-linear, late-time evolution of cosmic structures to try and
disentangle their fundamental properties caused by the cosmological model or
gravity theory itself. Conventionally, non-linear cosmic structure formation is
studied by means of computationally expensive numerical simulations. Since
these inevitably suffer from shot noise and are too time consuming to
systematically scrutinize large parameter spaces of cosmological models or
fundamental theories, analytical methods are needed to overcome the limitations
of numerical simulations.
  Recently, a new analytic approach to non-linear cosmic structure formation
has been proposed based on kinetic field theory for classical particle
ensembles. Within this theory, a closed, analytic, non-perturbative and
parameter-free equation could be derived for the non-linear power spectrum of
cosmic density perturbations which agrees very well with numerically simulated
results to wave numbers $k\lesssim10\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at redshift $z =

In the photosphere, magnetic flux emergence signatures are recognized in the
fuzzy granulation, with dark alignments between the emerging polarities,
cospatial with highly inclined fields. In the upper atmospheric layers, we
identify recurrent brightenings that resemble UV bursts, with counterparts in
all coronal passbands. These occur at the edges of the EFR and in the region of
the arch filament system (AFS) cospatial to the EFR. Jet activity is also found
at chromospheric and coronal levels, near the AFS and the observed brightness

of dense plasma in the low solar atmosphere and the driving of bi-directional
high-velocity flows with speeds up to 100 km/s at the same locations.
Furthermore, we detect a correlation between the Doppler velocity and line
width of the Si IV 1394 and 1402 \AA{} line profiles in the UV burst pixels and
their skewness. Comparing these findings with previous observations and

content.
  We measure gas fractions, HI morphology and kinematics in each galaxy, and
use archival optical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to reveal
star-formation histories and bar properties. HIRB galaxies presented here
support a picture where bar quenching is playing, or will play an important
role in their evolution. They also support models which show how the presence
of cold gas delays and slows the development of strong bars. The galaxies with
the lowest gas fractions (still high for their mass) show clear HI holes,
dynamical advanced bars and low star formation rates, those with the highest
gas fractions show little impact from their bar on the HI morphology, and are
actively star-forming. How such unusual galaxies came to be is an open
question.
  Several of the HIRBs have local gas rich companions. Tidal interactions with

http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01192v1,"One of the key questions in understanding the formation and evolution of
galaxies is how starbursts affect the assembly of stellar populations in
galaxies over time. We define a burst indicator ($\eta$), which compares a
galaxy's star formation rates on short ($\sim10$ Myr) and long ($\sim100$ Myr)
timescales. To estimate $\eta$, we apply the detailed temporal luminosity
response of H$\alpha$ and near-ultraviolet emission to simulated star formation
histories (SFHs) from Semi-Analytic Models and the Mufasa hydrodynamical
cosmological simulations. We find that the average value of $\eta$ is not
itself a good indicator of star formation stochasticity (burstiness); indeed we
show that this average should be close to zero unless the population being
studied has an average SFH which is rising or falling rapidly. Instead,
analyzing the width of the distribution of $\eta$ for ensembles of galaxies
allows us to characterize the level of burstiness in a galaxy population's
recent star formation history. We find this width to be robust to variations in
stellar initial mass function (IMF) and metallicity. We apply realistic noise
and selection effects to the models to generate mock HST and JWST galaxy
catalogs and compare these catalogs with 3D-HST observations of 956 galaxies at
$0.65<z<1.5$ detected in H$\alpha$. Measurements of $\eta$ are unaffected by
dust measurement errors under the assumption that
$E(B-V)_\mathrm{stars}=0.44\,E(B-V)_\mathrm{gas}$ (i.e., $Q_\mathrm{sg}=0.44$).
However, setting $Q_\mathrm{sg}=0.8^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$ removes an unexpected
dependence of the average value of $\eta$ upon dust attenuation and stellar
mass in the 3D-HST sample while also resolving disagreements in the
distribution of star formation rates. However, even varying the dust law cannot
resolve all discrepancies between the simulated and the observed galaxies.",astro-ph.GA,1901.01192v1,Camilla Pacifici,"Adam Broussard, Eric Gawiser, Kartheik Iyer, Peter Kurczynski, Rachel S.

mass (M$_{\rm star}$) of star-forming galaxies follow a tight relation known as
the galaxy main sequence. However, what physical information is encoded in this
relation is under debate. Here, we use the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical
simulation to study the mass dependence, evolution and origin of scatter in the
SFR-M$_{\rm star}$ relation. At $z=0$, we find that the scatter decreases
slightly with stellar mass from 0.35 dex at M$_{\rm star} \approx 10^9$

at $z=0.1$ originates from a combination of fluctuations on short time-scales
(ranging from 0.2-2 Gyr) that are presumably associated with self-regulation
from cooling, star formation and outflows, but is dominated by long time-scale
($\sim 10$ Gyr) variations related to differences in halo formation times.
Shorter time-scale fluctuations are relatively more important for lower-mass
galaxies. At high masses, differences in black hole formation efficiency cause
additional scatter, but also diminish the scatter caused by different halo
formation times. While individual galaxies cross the main sequence multiple
times during their evolution, they fluctuate around tracks associated with
their halo properties, i.e. galaxies above/below the main sequence at $z = 0.1$

accurately reproduce the posterior distributions obtained by standard MCMC

consist of a bright high priority sample to an r-band magnitude limit r ~ 19.5,
with a fainter low priority sample to r ~ 20. The geometry of the DESI fibre
positioners in the focal plane of the telescope affects the completeness of the
survey, and has a non-trivial impact on clustering measurements. Using a BGS
mock catalogue, we show that completeness due to fibre assignment primarily
depends on the surface density of galaxies. Completeness is high (>95%) in low
density regions, but very low (<10%) in the centre of massive clusters. We
apply the pair inverse probability (PIP) weighting correction to clustering
measurements from a BGS mock which has been through the fibre assignment
algorithm. This method is only unbiased if it is possible to observe every
galaxy pair. To facilitate this, we randomly promote a small fraction of the
fainter sample to be high priority, and dither the set of tile positions by a
small angle. We show that inverse pair weighting combined with angular
upweighting provides an unbiased correction to galaxy clustering measurements
for the complete 3 pass survey, and also after 1 pass, which is highly
incomplete.","astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA",1809.07355v2,Risa H. Wechsler,"Alex Smith, Jian-hua He, Shaun Cole, Lee Stothert, Peder Norberg, Carlton Baugh, Davide Bianchi, Michael J.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00901v2,"We present the first systematic study of strong binary-single and
binary-binary black hole interactions with the inclusion of general relativity.
When including general relativistic effects in strong encounters, dissipation
of orbital energy from gravitational waves (GWs) can lead to captures and
subsequent inspirals with appreciable eccentricities when entering the
sensitive frequency ranges of the LIGO and Virgo GW detectors. In this study,
we perform binary-binary and binary-single scattering experiments with general
relativistic dynamics up through the 2.5 post-Newtonian order included, both in
a controlled setting to gauge the importance of non-dissipative post-Newtonian
terms and derive scaling relations for the cross-section of GW captures, as
well as experiments tuned to the strong interactions from state-of-the art
globular cluster models to assess the relative importance of the binary-binary
channel at facilitating GW captures and the resultant eccentricity
distributions of inspiral from channel. Although binary-binary interactions are
10-100 times less frequent in globular clusters than binary-single
interactions, their longer lifetime and more complex dynamics leads to a higher
probability for GW captures to occur during the encounter. We find that
binary-binary interactions contribute 25-45% of the eccentric mergers which
occur during strong black hole encounters in globular clusters, regardless of
the properties of the cluster environment. The inclusion of higher multiplicity
encounters in dense star clusters therefore have major implications on the
predicted rates of highly eccentric binaries potentially detectable by the
LIGO/Virgo network. As gravitational waveforms of eccentric inspirals are
distinct from those generated by merging binaries which have circularized,
measurements of eccentricity in such systems would highly constrain their
formation scenario.","astro-ph.HE, gr-qc",1810.00901v2,Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz,"Michael Zevin, Johan Samsing, Carl Rodriguez, Carl-Johan Haster, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz","18 pages, 6 figures. Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical

local gravitational degrees of freedom. We classify modified gravity theories
into type-I and type-II: theories of type-I have an Einstein frame and can be
recast by change of variables as general relativity (GR) with a non-minimal
matter coupling, while theories of type-II have no Einstein frame. Considering
a canonical transformation of the lapse, the 3-dimensional induced metric and
their conjugate momenta we generate type-I MMG. We then show that
phenomenological deviations from GR, such as the speed of gravitational waves
$c_T$ and the effective gravitational constant for scalar perturbations $G_{\rm
eff}$, are characterized by two functions of an auxiliary variable. We study
the phenomenology of several models all having $c_T=1$. We obtain a scenario
with $c_T=1$ in which the effective equation-of-state parameter of dark energy
is different from $-1$ even though the cosmic acceleration is caused by a bare
cosmological constant, and we find that it is possible to reconstruct the

http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02060v2,"Exoplanets orbiting close to their host star are expected to support a large
ionosphere, which extends to larger pressures than witnessed in our Solar
System. These ionospheres can be investigated with ground-based transit
observations of the optical signatures of alkali metals, which are the source
of the ions. Here, we present new observations and analyses of optical transit
spectra that cover the Na doublet in the atmosphere of the exoplanet XO-2 b. To
assess the consistency of our results, observations were obtained from two
separate platforms: Gemini/GMOS and Mayall/KOSMOS. To mitigate the systematic
errors, we chose XO-2, because it has a binary companion of the same brightness
and stellar type, which provides an ideal reference star to model Earth's
atmospheric effects. We find that interpretation of the data is highly
sensitive to time-varying translations along the detector, which change
according to wavelength and differ between the target and reference star. It
was necessary to employ a time-dependent cross-correlation to align our
wavelength bins and correct for atmospheric differential refraction. This
approach allows us to resolve the wings of the Na line across 5 wavelength bins
at a resolution of $\sim$1.6nm and limit the abundance of Na. We obtain
consistent results from each telescope with a Na amplitude of 521$\pm$161 ppm
and 403$\pm$186 ppm for GMOS and KOSMOS respectively. The results are analyzed
with a radiative transfer model that includes the effects of ionization. The
data are consistent with a clear atmosphere between $\sim$1--100 mbar which
establish a lower limit on Na at 0.4$^{+2}_{-0.3}$ ppm
([Na/H]=-0.64$^{+0.78}_{-0.6}$), consistent with solar. However, we can not
rule out the presence of clouds at $\sim$10 mbar which allow for higher Na
abundances which would be consistent with stellar metallicity measured for the
host star ([Na/H]=0.485$\pm$0.043).",astro-ph.EP,1811.02060v2,Gael M. Roudier,"Kyle A. Pearson, Caitlin A. Griffith, Robert T. Zellem, Tommi T. Koskinen, Gael M. Roudier","AJ published, 20 pages, all code is available here:

binary black hole mergers detected in the first and second observing runs
completed by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. We constrain properties of the
binary black hole (BBH) mass spectrum using models with a range of
parameterizations of the BBH mass and spin distributions. We find that the mass
distribution of the more massive black hole in such binaries is well
approximated by models with no more than 1% of black holes more massive than
$45 M{}_{\odot}$, and a power law index of $\alpha = {{1.6}^{+1.5}_{-1.7}}$
(90% credibility). We also show that BBHs are unlikely to be composed of black
holes with large spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum. Modelling the
evolution of the BBH merger rate with redshift, we show that it is flat or
increasing with redshift with $88$% probability. Marginalizing over
uncertainties in the BBH population, we find robust estimates of the BBH merger
rate density of $R = {{53.2}^{+58.5}_{-28.8}}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ (90%

relatively higher (or episodic) mass accretion than the past. There are strong
trends that outflows of many proto-BDs are less active if they are fainter or
have less massive envelopes. The outflow forces and internal luminosities for

set consisting of 193 GRB distance moduli. We combine this sample with the

MBSs per edge, by virtue of a chiral or unitary symmetry. We find that, while
the ABS dispersions are $2\pi$-periodic, they still contain multiple crossings
which are protected by the conservation of fermion parity. Considering networks

bandstructures with nodes or Weyl points in synthetic dimensions, and the

order parameter can be employed to manipulate the zero-energy Majorana bound
states (MBSs) occurring in a topological Josephson junction. We focus on an
interface of two p-wave superconductors, which are described by a spin-vector
order parameter $\bf{d}$. Apart from the sensitivity of $\bf{d}$ to external
Zeeman/exchange fields, here, we show that the orientation of $\bf{d}$
throughout the junction can be controlled by electrically gating the weak link.
The remarkable local character of this knob is a manifestation of the edge
reconstruction of the order parameter, which takes place whenever different
$\bf{d}$-vector configurations in each superconductor compete and are close in
energy. As a consequence, the spin-dependent superconducting-phase difference
across the junction is switchable from $0$ to $\pi$. Moreover, in the regime
where multiple edge MBSs occur for each superconductor, the Andreev-bound-state
(ABS) spectra can be twisted by the application of either a charge- or
spin-phase difference across the interface, and give rise to a rich diversity
of nonstandard ABS dispersions. Interestingly, some of these dispersions show
band crossings protected by fermion parity, despite their $2\pi$-periodic
character. These crossings additionally unlock the possibility of nontrivial
topology in synthetic spaces, when considering networks of such 1D junctions.
Lastly, the interface MBSs induce a distinct elecronic spin polarization near
the junction, which possesses a characteristic spatial pattern that allows the
detection of MBSs using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy. These
findings unveil novel paths to mechanisms for ABS engineering and single-out
signatures relevant for the experimental detection and manipulation of MBSs.","cond-mat.supr-con, cond-mat.mes-hall",1901.00878v1,Mario Cuoco,"Maria Teresa Mercaldo, Panagiotis Kotetes, Mario Cuoco","19 pages, 6 figures",2019-01-07 20:05:11,No journal ref found,Mario Cuoco,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00878v1,cond-mat.supr-con,2019-01-03T19:04:13Z,"Magnetoelectrically-Tunable Andreev-Bound-State Spectra and Spin

magnetic orders, is a very desirable property to combine functionalities of
materials for next-generation switchable devices. Multiferroics with
spin-driven ferroelectricity presents such a mutual interaction concomitant
with magneto- and electro-active excitations called electromagnons. TbMnO3 is a
paradigmatic material in which two electromagnons have been observed in the
cycloidal magnetic phase. However, their observation in TbMnO3 is restricted to
the cycloidal spin phase and magnetic ground states that can support the

Raman spectroscopy measurements under pressure that the lower-energy
electromagnon (4 meV) disappears when the ground state enters from a cycloidal
phase to an antiferromagnetic phase (E-type). On the contrary, the
magnetoelectric activity of the higher-energy electromagnon (8 meV) increases
in intensity by one order of magnitude. Using microscopic model calculations,
we demonstrate that the lowerenergy electromagnon, observed in the cycloidal
phase, originates from a higher harmonic of the magnetic cycloid, and we
determine that the symmetric exchange-striction mechanism is at the origin of
the higher-energy electromagnon which survives even in the E-type phase. The

at a surface or interface are modified and then spatially transferred, in a
layer-by-layer bootstrapped manner, into the film interior in the context of
the dynamic free energy concept of the Nonlinear Langevin Equation theory
approach. The dynamic free energy at any mean location involves contributions
from two adjacent layers where confining forces are not the same. At the most
fundamental level of the theory, the caging component of the dynamic free
energy varies essentially exponentially with distance from the interface,
saturating deep enough into the film with a correlation length of modest size
and weak sensitivity to thermodynamic state. This imparts a roughly exponential
spatial variation of all the key features of the dynamic free energy required
to compute gradients of dynamical quantities including the localization length,
jump distance, cage barrier, collective elastic barrier and alpha relaxation
time. The spatial gradients are entire of dynamical, not structural nor
thermodynamic, origin. The theory is implemented for the hard sphere fluid and
diverse interfaces which can be a vapor, a rough pinned particle solid, a
vibrating pinned particle solid, or a smooth hard wall. Their basic description
at the level of the spatially-heterogeneous dynamic free energy is identical,
with the crucial difference arising from the first layer where dynamical
constraints can be weakened, softened, or hardly changed depending on the
specific interface. Numerical calculations establish the spatial dependence and
fluid volume fraction sensitivity of the key dynamical property gradients for

with nearest-neighbor hopping only. For strong $J$, we find a transition from
antiferromagnetic to incommensurate magnetic short-range order, which can be
understood entirely in the classical-spin picture. For weaker $J$, a
spin-dimerized phase emerges, which spontaneously breaks the discrete
translation symmetry. The phase is not accessible to perturbative means but is
explained, on a qualitative level, by the classical-spin model as well. Spin
dimerization alleviates magnetic frustration and is interpreted as a key to
understand the emergence of quasi-long-range spiral magnetic order which is
found at weaker couplings. The phase diagram at weak $J$, with gapless
quasi-long-range order on top of the two-fold degenerate spin-dimerized ground
state, competing with a nondegenerate phase with gapped spin (and charge)
excitations, is unconventional and eludes an effective low-energy spin-only

reservoirs at different temperatures or chemical potentials, it cannot achieve
a global thermal equilibrium and is instead driven to a set of current-carrying
non-equilibrium states. Despite the broad relevance of such a scenario to
metallic systems, there have been limited investigations of the entanglement
structure of the resulting long-time states, in part, due to the fundamental
difficulty in solving realistic models for disordered, interacting electrons.
We investigate this problem using two ""toy"" models for coherent quantum
transport of diffusive fermions: the celebrated three-dimensional,
non-interacting Anderson model, and a class of random quantum circuits acting
on a chain of qubits, which exactly maps to a diffusive, interacting fermion
problem. Crucially, the random circuit model can also be tuned to have no
interactions between the fermions, similar to the Anderson model. We show that
the long-time states of driven non-interacting fermions exhibit volume-law
mutual information and entanglement, both for our random circuit model and for
the non-equilibrium steady-state of the Anderson model. With interactions, the
random circuit model is quantum chaotic and approaches local equilibrium, with
only short-range entanglement. These results provide a generic picture for the
emergence of local equilibrium in current-driven quantum-chaotic systems, as
well as provide examples of stable highly-entangled many-body states out of

Computational Materials Design (CMD). However, existing microstructure
characterization and reconstruction (MCR) techniques have limitations to be

reduction tend to lose important microstructural information. In this work, we
present a deep adversarial learning methodology that overcomes the limitations
of existing MCR techniques. In the proposed methodology, generative adversarial

microstructures with desired material property. Due to the special design of
the network architecture, the proposed methodology is able to identify the
latent (design) variables with desired dimensionality, as well as minimize the

spectroscopy study on this compound of both the phonon modes and the low energy
excitations from 4 K to room temperature. A detailed study of the Raman active
phonon excitations shows that three phonon modes evidence a spin-phonon
coupling at TN2 = 50 K. In particular, we show that the mode at 432 cm-1
associated to Mn(B)O6 (B position of the perovskite) rotations around the [111]
cubic diagonal is impacted by the magnetic transition at 50 K and its coupling
to the new modulation of the Mn spin in the (a,b) plane. At low energies, two
large low energy excitations are observed at 25 and 47 cm-1. The first one
disappears at 50 K and the second one at 90 K. We have associated these
excitations to electro-magneto-active modes.","cond-mat.str-el, cond-mat.mtrl-sci",1810.03472v2,M. Cazayous,"C. Toulouse, C. Martin, M-A. Measson, Y. Gallais, A. Sacuto, M.

define the spin MQM by calculating the spin density in a nonuniform system. Our
definition is analogous to that of the charge polarization, but the result is
gauge invariant and coincides with the latter previous one. We also formulate
what we call gravitomagnetoelectric (gravito-ME) effect, in which the
magnetization is induced by a temperature gradient. Although the Kubo formula
for the gravito-ME effect provides an unphysical divergence at zero
temperature, we prove that the correct susceptibility is obtained by
subtracting the spin MQM from the Kubo formula. It vanishes at zero temperature

http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00501v2,"Recent theoretical and experimental work has demonstrated how the
superconducting critical temperature $(T_c)$ can be modified by rotating the
magnetisation of a single homogeneous ferromagnet proximity-coupled to the
superconducting layer. This occurs when the superconductor and ferromagnet are
separated by a thin heavy normal metal which provides an enhanced interfacial
Rashba spin-orbit interaction. We consider the reciprocal effect: magnetisation
reorientation driven by the superconducting phase transition. We solve the
tight-binding Bogolioubov-de Gennes equations on a lattice self-consistentl and
find that the relative angle between the spin-orbit field and the magnetisation
gives rise to a contribution in the free energy even in the normal state, due
to band-structure effects. For temperatures below $T_c$, superconductivity
gives rise to a competing contribution. We demonstrate that by lowering the
temperature, in addition to reorientation of the favoured magnetisation
direction from in-plane (IP) to out-of-plane (OOP), a $\pi/4$ IP rotation for
thicker ferromagnetic layers is possible. Furthermore, computation of $T_c$ in
the ballistic limit shows a dependence on the IP orientation of the
magnetisation - in contrast to our previous result on diffusive limit. This
finding is relevant with respect to thin-film heterostructures which are likely
to be in the ballistic regime of transport. Finally, we discuss the
experimental feasibility of observing the magnetic anisotropy induced by the
superconducting transition when other magnetic anisotropies, such as the shape
anisotropy for a ferromagnetic film, are taken into account. Our work suggests
that the superconducting condensation energy in principle can trigger a
reorientation of the magnetisation of a thin-film ferromagnet upon lowering the

additional complication is that the definition of an informal settlement is

makes it challenging to teach a machine what to look for. Due to these

contains a series of low and very-high resolution imagery, with accompanying
ground truth annotations marking the locations of known informal settlements.
2) We demonstrate that it is possible to detect informal settlements using

use very-high resolution (VHR) satellite and aerial imagery, which is typically
cost-prohibitive for NGOs. 3) We demonstrate two effective classification
schemes on our curated data set, one that is cost-efficient for NGOs and
another that is cost-prohibitive for NGOs, but has additional utility. We

as it can lead to de-anonymization, the inference of sensitive information, and
even physical threats. In this paper we present LPAuditor, a tool that conducts
a comprehensive evaluation of the privacy loss caused by publicly available
location metadata. First, we demonstrate how our system can pinpoint users' key
locations at an unprecedented granularity by identifying their actual postal
addresses. Our experimental evaluation on Twitter data highlights the
effectiveness of our techniques which outperform prior approaches by
18.9%-91.6% for homes and 8.7%-21.8% for workplaces. Next we present a novel
exploration of automated private information inference that uncovers
""sensitive"" locations that users have visited (pertaining to health, religion,
and sex/nightlife). We find that location metadata can provide additional
context to tweets and thus lead to the exposure of private information that
might not match the users' intentions.
  We further explore the mismatch between user actions and information exposure
and find that older versions of the official Twitter apps follow a
privacy-invasive policy of including precise GPS coordinates in the metadata of
tweets that users have geotagged at a coarse-grained level (e.g., city). The
implications of this exposure are further exacerbated by our finding that users
are considerably privacy-cautious in regards to exposing precise location data.
When users can explicitly select what location data is published, there is a
94.6% reduction in tweets with GPS coordinates. As part of current efforts to
give users more control over their data, LPAuditor can be adopted by major
services and offered as an auditing tool that informs users about sensitive
information they (indirectly) expose through location metadata.","cs.CY, cs.CR",1901.00897v1,Jason Polakis,"Kostas Drakonakis, Panagiotis Ilia, Sotiris Ioannidis, Jason Polakis",No comment found,2019-01-07 20:06:57,No journal ref found,Jason Polakis,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00897v1,cs.CY,2019-01-03T20:09:11Z,"Please Forget Where I Was Last Summer: The Privacy Risks of Public

conventional methods. Furthermore, the reformulation of descriptors with LAT
shows superiority to conventional methods, which is a promising result for the

in successive stages. Neural representations vary drastically across the first
stages of visual processing: at the output of the retina, ganglion cell
receptive fields (RFs) exhibit a clear antagonistic center-surround structure,
whereas in the primary visual cortex, typical RFs are sharply tuned to a
precise orientation. There is currently no unified theory explaining these
differences in representations across layers. Here, using a deep convolutional
neural network trained on image recognition as a model of the visual system, we
show that such differences in representation can emerge as a direct consequence
of different neural resource constraints on the retinal and cortical networks,
and we find a single model from which both geometries spontaneously emerge at
the appropriate stages of visual processing. The key constraint is a reduced
number of neurons at the retinal output, consistent with the anatomy of the
optic nerve as a stringent bottleneck. Second, we find that, for simple
cortical networks, visual representations at the retinal output emerge as
nonlinear and lossy feature detectors, whereas they emerge as linear and
faithful encoders of the visual scene for more complex cortices. This result
predicts that the retinas of small vertebrates should perform sophisticated
nonlinear computations, extracting features directly relevant to behavior,
whereas retinas of large animals such as primates should mostly encode the
visual scene linearly and respond to a much broader range of stimuli. These
predictions could reconcile the two seemingly incompatible views of the retina

we argue that it is time to revisit in-network filtering or the idea of
empowering DDoS victims to install in-network traffic filters in the upstream
transit networks. Recent proposals have suggested that filtering DDoS traffic
at a small number of large transit networks on behalf of remote DDoS victims
can handle large volumetric attacks effectively. However, even if a transit
network wishes to offer filtering services to remote DDoS victims, there still
remains a practical issue of the lack of verifiable filtering - no one can
check if the filtering service executes the filter rules correctly as requested
by the DDoS victims. Without filtering verifiability, neighbor autonomous
systems (ASes) and DDoS victims cannot detect when filtering is executed poorly
or unfairly discriminates neighbor ASes. In this paper, we show the technical
feasibility of verifiable in-network filtering, called VIF, that offers
filtering verifiability to DDoS victims and neighbor ASes. We utilize Intel SGX
as a feasible root of trust. As a practical deployment model, we suggest that
Internet exchange points (IXPs) are the ideal candidates for the early adopters
of our verifiable filters due to their central locations and flexible
software-defined architecture. Our proof of concept demonstrates that a single
VIF filter can handle nearly 10Gb/s traffic and execute up to 3000 filter
rules. We show that VIF can easily scale to handle larger traffic volume (e.g.,
500 Gb/s) and more complex filtering operations (e.g., 150,000 rules) by
parallelizing SGX-based filters. Furthermore, our large-scale simulations of
two realistic attacks (i.e., DNS amplification, Mirai-based flooding) show that
only a small number (e.g., 5-25) of large IXPs are needed to offer VIF
filtering service to handle the majority (e.g., up to 80-90%) of DDoS traffic.",cs.CR,1901.00955v1,Min Suk Kang,"Deli Gong, Muoi Tran, Shweta Shinde, Hao Jin, Vyas Sekar, Prateek Saxena, Min Suk Kang",No comment found,2019-01-07 20:07:22,No journal ref found,Min Suk Kang,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00955v1,cs.CR,2019-01-04T00:34:04Z,Practical Verifiable In-network Filtering for DDoS defense,2019-01-07 20:07:22

all sharing the same resources. However, current wireless edge networks that
cater to worst or average case performance lack the agility to best serve these
diverse sessions. Simultaneously, software reconfigurable infrastructure has
become increasingly mainstream to the point that dynamic per packet and per
flow decisions are possible at multiple layers of the communications stack.
Exploiting such reconfigurability requires the design of a system that can
enable a configuration, measure the impact on the application performance
(Quality of Experience), and adaptively select a new configuration.
Effectively, this feedback loop is a Markov Decision Process whose parameters
are unknown. The goal of this work is to design, develop and demonstrate QFlow
that instantiates this feedback loop as an application of reinforcement
learning (RL). Our context is that of reconfigurable (priority) queueing, and
we use the popular application of video streaming as our use case. We develop
both model-free and model-based RL approaches that are tailored to the problem
of determining which clients should be assigned to which queue at each decision
period. Through experimental validation, we show how the RL-based control
policies on QFlow are able to schedule the right clients for prioritization in
a high-load scenario to outperform the status quo, as well as the best known

focus a number of practical issues in form factor user equipment (UE) design.
With wavelengths becoming smaller, antenna gain patterns becoming directional,
and link budgets critically dependent on beamforming, it becomes imperative to
use a number of antenna modules at different locations of the UE for good
performance. While more antennas/modules can enhance beamforming array gains,
it comes with the tradeoff of higher component cost, power consumption of the
associated radio frequency circuitry, and a beam management overhead in
learning the appropriate beam weights. Thus, the goal of a good UE design is to
provide robust spherical coverage corresponding to good array gains over the
entire sphere around the UE with a low beam management overhead, complexity,
and cost. The scope of this paper is to study the implications of two popular
commercial millimeter wave UE designs (a face and an edge design) on spherical
coverage. We show that analog beam codebooks can result in good performance for
both the designs, and the edge design provides a better tradeoff in terms of
robust performance (with hand blockage), beam management overhead,

decomposition of the domain that wraps the wall boundaries with partitions
suitable for the generation of either prismatic or hexahedral elements. The
latter is a novel distinctive feature of the method that permits to obtain
well-shaped hexahedral meshes at corners or junctions in the boundary layer.
The medial object approach allows greater control on the ""thickness"" of the
boundary-layer mesh than is generally achievable with advancing layer
techniques. CADfix subsequently generates a hybrid straight sided mesh of
prismatic and hexahedral elements in the near-field region modelling the
boundary layer, and tetrahedral elements in the far-field region covering the

facilitates the generation, via an isoparametric technique, of layers of highly
stretched elements with a distribution of points in the direction normal to the
wall tailored to efficiently and accurately capture the flow in the boundary
layer. The final step is the generation of a high-order mesh using NekMesh, a

recommendation has attracted increasing research efforts recently. Among all
the recommendation tasks, an important one is social item recommendation over
high speed social media streams. Existing streaming recommendation techniques
are not effective for handling social users with diverse interests. Meanwhile,
approaches for recommending items to a particular user are not efficient when
applied to a huge number of users over high speed streams. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework for the social recommendation over streaming
environments. Specifically, we first propose a novel Bi-Layer Hidden Markov
Model (BiHMM) that adaptively captures the behaviors of social users and their
interactions with influential official accounts to predict their long-term and
short-term interests. Then, we design a new probabilistic entity matching
scheme for effectively identifying the relevance score of a streaming item to a
user. Following that, we propose a novel indexing scheme called {\Tree} for
improving the efficiency of our solution. Extensive experiments are conducted
to prove the high performance of our approach in terms of the recommendation

http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01007v1,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have revolutionized numerous applications, but
the demand for ever more performance remains unabated. Scaling DNN computations
to larger clusters is generally done by distributing tasks in batch mode using
methods such as distributed synchronous SGD. Among the issues with this
approach is that to make the distributed cluster work with high utilization,
the workload distributed to each node must be large, which implies nontrivial
growth in the SGD mini-batch size.
  In this paper, we propose a framework called FPDeep, which uses a hybrid of
model and layer parallelism to configure distributed reconfigurable clusters to
train DNNs. This approach has numerous benefits. First, the design does not
suffer from batch size growth. Second, novel workload and weight partitioning
leads to balanced loads of both among nodes. And third, the entire system is a
fine-grained pipeline. This leads to high parallelism and utilization and also
minimizes the time features need to be cached while waiting for
back-propagation. As a result, storage demand is reduced to the point where
only on-chip memory is used for the convolution layers. We evaluate FPDeep with
the Alexnet, VGG-16, and VGG-19 benchmarks. Experimental results show that
FPDeep has good scalability to a large number of FPGAs, with the limiting
factor being the FPGA-to-FPGA bandwidth. With 6 transceivers per FPGA, FPDeep
shows linearity up to 83 FPGAs. Energy efficiency is evaluated with respect to

areas. However, to attain this success, DNNs often carry a large number of
weight parameters, leading to heavy costs of memory and computation resources.
Overfitting is also likely to happen in such network when the training data are
insufficient. These shortcomings severely hinder the application of DNNs in
resource-constrained platforms. In fact, many network weights are known to be
redundant and can be removed from the network without much loss of performance.
To this end, we introduce a new non-convex integrated transformed $\ell_1$
regularizer to promote sparsity for DNNs, which removes both redundant
connections and unnecessary neurons simultaneously. To be specific, we apply
the transformed $\ell_1$ to the matrix space of network weights and utilize it
to remove redundant connections. Besides, group sparsity is also employed as an
auxiliary to remove unnecessary neurons. An efficient stochastic proximal

notably systems biology, control engineering and biomedicine. To develop a
therapy, it is essential to understand the connectivity of biochemical units

characterized by its topology and internal dynamics. In particular, sparse
topology and stable system dynamics are fundamental properties of many
real-world networks. In recent years, kernel-based methods have been popular in
the system identification community. By incorporating empirical Bayes, this
framework, which we call KEB, is able to promote system stability and impose

structure functions to describe networks so that the information of
unmeasurable nodes is encoded in the model. A powerful numerical sampling
method, namely reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC), is applied to
explore full Bayesian models effectively. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that
our approach produces more accurate networks compared with KEB methods.

apps, but one third of our randomly sampled apps are suffering from energy
issues that can quickly drain battery. To understand these issues, we conducted
an empirical study on 27 well-maintained apps (e.g., Chrome and Firefox), whose
issue tracking systems are publicly accessible. Our study revealed that the
main causes of energy issues are unnecessary workload, excessively frequent
operations, etc. Surprisingly, these issues are beyond the application of the
cutting-edge technology on energy issue detection. We also found 20.7% energy
issues can only be manifested under special context such as bad performance of

findings, we proposed a novel testing framework for detecting energy issues in
real-world. We will see that assessing the necessity of workload is critical
for identifying the issues of main causes. We hence employed machine learning
algorithm to cluster the workloads and further evaluate their necessity.
Besides, we also devised a set of artificial running contexts to productively
uncover the neglected issues. More importantly, we developed a suit of
practical technology to achieve high accuracy and efficacy of our testing

years, yielding remarkable progress. Current state-of-the-art methods are
either based on maximum likelihood estimation or adversarial training. Both
methods have their own drawbacks, which are complementary in nature. The first
leads to over-generalization as the maximum likelihood criterion encourages
models to cover the support of the training data by heavily penalizing small
masses assigned to training data. Simplifying assumptions in such models limits
their capacity and makes them spill mass on unrealistic samples. The second
leads to mode-dropping since adversarial training encourages high quality
samples from the model, but only indirectly enforces diversity among the
samples. To overcome these drawbacks we make two contributions. First, we
propose a novel extension to the variational autoencoders model by using
deterministic invertible transformation layers to map samples from the decoder
to the image space. This induces correlations among the pixels given the latent
variables, improving over commonly used factorial decoders. Second, we propose
a training approach that leverages coverage and quality based criteria. Our

policy layers: the declared flow policy, established by the program itself, and
the allowed flow policy, established externally to the program by each

behaviors of programs comply to the respective flow policies: Distributed
Non-disclosure, for enabling programs to declare locally scoped flow policies;
and Flow Policy Confinement, for controlling the flow policies that are
declared by programs. We present enforcement mechanisms that are based on type

are in general data hungry. Their data curation poses the challenges of
expensive human labeling, inadequate computing resources and larger experiment
turn around times. Training data subset selection and active learning
techniques have been proposed as possible solutions to these challenges. A
special class of subset selection functions naturally model notions of
diversity, coverage and representation and can be used to eliminate redundancy
thus lending themselves well for training data subset selection. They can also
help improve the efficiency of active learning in further reducing human
labeling efforts by selecting a subset of the examples obtained using the
conventional uncertainty sampling based techniques. In this work, we
empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of two diversity models, namely the
Facility-Location and Dispersion models for training-data subset selection and
reducing labeling effort. We demonstrate this across the board for a variety of
computer vision tasks including Gender Recognition, Face Recognition, Scene

diversity based subset selection done in the right way can increase the

Power Transfer (WPT) has recently emerged in the communication literature.
Promising signal strategies to maximize the power transfer efficiency of WPT

a combination thereof. The study of those strategies has so far been limited to
theoretical performance analysis. In this paper, we study the real over-the-air

we have designed, prototyped and experimented an innovative radiative WPT
architecture based on Software-Defined Radio (SDR) that can operate in
open-loop and closed-loop (with channel acquisition at the transmitter) modes.
The prototype consists of three important blocks, namely the channel estimator,
the signal generator, and the energy harvester. The experiments have been
conducted in a variety of deployments, including frequency flat and frequency
selective channels, under static and mobility conditions. Experiments highlight
that a channel-adaptive WPT architecture relying on a 2-transmit antenna
16-sinewave waveform offers a 350\% performance improvement in harvested DC
power over a conventional single-antenna continuous wave. The experimental
results fully validate the observations predicted from the theoretical signal

permits unprivileged monitoring of some memory accesses of other processes,
with a spatial resolution of 4KB and a temporal resolution of 2 microseconds on

systematically analyze our side channel by demonstrating different local

Google, AWS, Baidu, to offer various computer vision related services including

services are more complex than classification and there is little literature
about adversarial example attacks on detection services. In this paper, we
mainly focus on studying the security of real-world cloud-based image

conduct an extensive empirical study of black-box attacks against real-world
cloud-based image detectors. Through evaluations on five popular cloud
platforms including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Baidu Cloud and Alibaba Cloud, we
demonstrate that our IP attack has a success rate of approximately 100%, and
semantic segmentation based attacks (e.g., SP, SBLS, SBB) have a a success rate

corruptions. Our proposed method registers the frames of the corrupted video
and then encodes the varying perspective arising from camera motion as missing
data in a global model. This formulation allows our algorithm to produce a
panoramic background component that automatically stitches together corrupted
data from partially overlapping frames to reconstruct the full field of view.
We model the registered video as the sum of a low-rank component that captures
the background, a smooth component that captures the dynamic foreground of the
scene, and a sparse component that isolates possible outliers and other sparse
corruptions in the video. The low-rank portion of our model is based on a
recent low-rank matrix estimator (OptShrink) that has been shown to yield
superior low-rank subspace estimates in practice. To estimate the smooth
foreground component of our model, we use a weighted total variation framework
that enables our method to reliably decouple the true foreground of the video
from sparse corruptions. We perform extensive numerical experiments on both
static and moving camera video subject to a variety of dense and sparse
corruptions. Our experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of
our proposed method compared to existing methods both in terms of foreground
and background estimation accuracy.","stat.ML, cs.CV",1712.06229v3,Raj Rao Nadakuditi,"Brian E. Moore, Chen Gao, Raj Rao Nadakuditi","IEEE TCI. Project webpage: https://gaochen315.github.io/pRPCA/ Code:

correlations and surges in activity---across a range of social, political, and

come from, or if there even exists a set of unifying principles. Indeed,
existing explanations typically rely on context-specific mechanisms, such as
traffic jams driven by work schedules or spikes in online traffic induced by
significant events. However, analogies with statistical mechanics suggest a
more general mechanism: that collective patterns can emerge organically from
fine-scale interactions within a population. Here, across four different modes

theory is the so-called `conditional joint typicality lemma'. In addition to
the lemma, one often uses unions and intersections of typical sets in the inner
bound arguments without so much as giving them a second thought. These
arguments fail spectacularly in the quantum setting. This bottleneck shows up
in the fact that so-called `simultaneous decoders', as opposed to `successive
cancellation decoders', are known for very few channels in quantum network
information theory. Another manifestation of this bottleneck is the lack of
so-called `simutaneous smoothing' theorems for quantum states.
  In this paper, we overcome the bottleneck by proving for the first time a
one-shot quantum joint typicality lemma with robust union and intersection
properties. To do so, we develop two novel tools in quantum information theory
which may be of independent interest. The first tool is a simple geometric idea
called `tilting', which increases the angles between a family of subspaces in
orthogonal directions. The second tool, called `smoothing', is a way of
perturbing a multipartite quantum state such that the partial trace over any
subset of registers does not increase the operator norm by much.
  Our joint typicality lemma allows us to construct simultaneous quantum
decoders for many multiterminal quantum channels. It provides a powerful tool

use time-scale separation and renewal theory to analytically derive an

present a method to turn this approximation into a molecular circuit. By using
simulation, we show that the output of the derived molecular circuit is
approximately equal to the log-posteriori probability calculated by the exact

arbitrary sized graphs into fixed-sized aligned vertex grid structures. In
order to learn representative graph characteristics, a new quantum spatial

employ the traditional convolutional neural network architecture to further

strict preference lists. A matching $M$ is popular in $G$ if $M$ does not lose
a head-to-head election against any matching where vertices are voters. Every
stable matching is popular; another subclass of popular matchings that always
exist and can be easily computed is the set of dominant matchings. A popular
matching $M$ is dominant if $M$ wins the head-to-head election against any
larger matching. The set of dominant matchings is the linear image of the set
of stable matchings in an auxiliary graph.
  In this paper, we investigate the difference between the tractability of
stable and dominant matchings, and its consequence for popular matchings. We
give the first known complete description of the dominant matching polytope in
the original space and show that it has an exponential number of facets (recall
that the stable matching polytope has a linear number of facets). This
polyhedral asymmetry is reflected by a complexity asymmetry: We show that it is
easy to decide if every popular matching in $G$ is also stable, however it is
co-NP hard to decide if every popular matching in $G$ is also dominant.
  We show that several hardness results in popular matchings, including the
above result and the hardness of finding a popular matching in a non-bipartite
graph, can be attributed to the NP-hardness of the following two stable
matching problems:
  - does $G$ admit a stable matching that is not dominant?
  - does $G$ admit a stable matching that is also dominant?
  These problems reduce to finding stable matchings that have / do not have
certain augmenting paths and surprisingly, finding such matchings is hard.","cs.DM, 05C85, 05C70",1811.06897v3,Vladlena Powers,"Agnes Cseh, Yuri Faenza, Telikepalli Kavitha, Vladlena Powers",No comment found,2019-01-07 20:10:54,No journal ref found,Vladlena Powers,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.06897v3,cs.DM,2018-11-16T16:37:51Z,"Popularity, stability, and the dominant matching polytope",2019-01-07 20:10:54

involves a central controller and a group of learners. In particular, two DRL
settings encountered in several applications are considered: multi-agent
reinforcement learning (RL) and parallel RL, where frequent information
exchanges between the learners and the controller are required. For many
practical distributed systems, however, such as those involving parallel
machines for training deep RL algorithms, and multi-robot systems for learning
the optimal coordination strategies, the overhead caused by these frequent
communication exchanges is considerable, and becomes the bottleneck of the
overall performance. To address this challenge, a novel policy gradient method
is developed here to cope with such communication-constrained DRL settings. The
proposed approach reduces the communication overhead without degrading learning
performance by adaptively skipping the policy gradient communication during
iterations. It is established analytically that i) the novel algorithm has
convergence rate identical to that of the plain-vanilla policy gradient for
DRL; while ii) if the distributed computing units are heterogeneous in terms of
their reward functions and initial state distributions, the number of
communication rounds needed to achieve a desirable learning accuracy is
markedly reduced. Numerical experiments on a popular multi-agent RL benchmark
corroborate the significant communication reduction attained by the novel

$\bm{\mathrm{z}}_s$ is assumed to follow the Gaussian mixture distribution in
which each component corresponds to a particular class. The parameters for the

novel over-the-air computation based approach for fast global model aggregation
via exploring the superposition property of a wireless multiple-access channel.
This is achieved by joint device selection and beamforming design, which is
modeled as a sparse and low-rank optimization problem to support efficient
algorithms design. To achieve this goal, we provide a
difference-of-convex-functions (DC) representation for the sparse and low-rank
function to enhance sparsity and accurately detect the fixed-rank constraint in
the procedure of device selection. A DC algorithm is further developed to solve
the resulting DC program with global convergence guarantees. The algorithmic
advantages and admirable performance of the proposed methodologies are
demonstrated through extensive numerical results.","cs.LG, cs.IT, eess.SP, math.IT, stat.ML",1812.11750v2,Zhi Ding,"Kai Yang, Tao Jiang, Yuanming Shi, Zhi Ding",No comment found,2019-01-07 20:11:20,No journal ref found,Zhi Ding,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.11750v2,cs.LG,2018-12-31T10:29:57Z,Federated Learning via Over-the-Air Computation,2019-01-07 20:11:20

$x$ be an $n$-dimensional vector of formal variables over a semigroup $(S,
\circ)$. How many semigroup operations are required to compute the linear
operator $Ax$?
  As we observe in this paper, this problem contains as a special case the
well-known range queries problem and has a rich variety of applications in such
areas as graph algorithms, functional programming, circuit complexity, and
others. It is easy to compute $Ax$ using $O(u)$ semigroup operations. The main
question studied in this paper is: can $Ax$ be computed using $O(z)$ semigroup
operations? We prove that in general this is not possible: there exists a
matrix $A \in \{0,1\}^{n \times n}$ with exactly two zeroes in every row (hence
$z=2n$) whose complexity is $\Theta(n\alpha(n))$ where $\alpha(n)$ is the
inverse Ackermann function. However, for the case when the semigroup is
commutative, we give a constructive proof of an $O(z)$ upper bound. This
implies that in commutative settings, complements of sparse matrices can be
processed as efficiently as sparse matrices (though the corresponding
algorithms are more involved). Note that this covers the cases of Boolean and
tropical semirings that have numerous applications, e.g., in graph theory.
  As a simple application of the presented linear-size construction, we show
how to multiply two $n\times n$ matrices over an arbitrary semiring in $O(n^2)$
time if one of these matrices is a 0/1-matrix with $O(n)$ zeroes (i.e., a
complement of a sparse matrix).",cs.CC,1812.11772v2,Vladimir Podolskii,"Alexander S.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11922v2,"Deep approaches to predict monocular depth and ego-motion have grown in
recent years due to their ability to produce dense depth from monocular images.
The main idea behind them is to optimize the photometric consistency over image
sequences by warping one view into another, similar to direct visual odometry
methods. One major drawback is that these methods infer depth from a single
view, which might not effectively capture the relation between pixels.
Moreover, simply minimizing the photometric loss does not ensure proper pixel
correspondences, which is a key factor for accurate depth and pose estimations.
  In contrast, we propose a 2-view depth network to infer the scene depth from
consecutive frames, thereby learning inter-pixel relationships. To ensure
better correspondences, thereby better geometric understanding, we propose
incorporating epipolar constraints to make the learning more geometrically
sound. We use the Essential matrix obtained using Nist'er's Five Point
Algorithm, to enforce meaningful geometric constraints, rather than using it as
training labels. This allows us to use lesser no. of trainable parameters
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method results in better
depth images and pose estimates, which capture the scene structure and motion
in a better way. Such a geometrically constrained learning performs
successfully even in cases where simply minimizing the photometric error would
fail.","cs.RO, cs.CV",1812.11922v2,Brojeshwar Bhowmick,"Vignesh Prasad, Dipanjan Das, Brojeshwar Bhowmick","ICVGIP 2018 Best Paper Award. arXiv admin note: substantial text

input the symptoms using the buttons on the device and can take pictures using
the same mechanism. The algorithm processes inputted symptoms, providing
diagnosis and possible treatment options for common conditions. The purpose of
this work was to be able to diagnose diseases through an affordable processor
with high accuracy, as it is currently achieving an accuracy of 90% for Top-5
symptom-based diagnoses, and 91% for visual skin diseases. The NNs achieve

fifth generation (5G) wireless systems to achieve the expected 1000x data rate.
With large bandwidth at mmWave band, the link capacity between users and base

Meanwhile, due to the high cost of infrastructure upgrade, it would be
difficult for operators to drastically enhance the capacity of backhaul links
between mmWave BSs and the core network. As a result, the data rate provided by
backhaul may not be sufficient to support all mmWave links, the backhaul
connection becomes the new bottleneck that limits the system performance. On
the other hand, as mmWave channels are subject to random blockage, the data
rates of mmWave users significantly vary over time. With limited backhaul
capacity and highly dynamic data rates of users, how to allocate backhaul
resource to each user remains a challenge for mmWave systems. In this article,
we present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to address this
challenge. By learning the blockage pattern, the system dynamics can be
captured and predicted, resulting in efficient utilization of backhaul

above initial conditions, the PNA vanishes at the initial time and later it is
generated through the interaction between the complex scalar and the

effects up to the first order of the perturbation. The expanding universe
causes the effects of the dilution of the PNA, freezing interaction and the

binary-binary black hole interactions with the inclusion of general relativity.
When including general relativistic effects in strong encounters, dissipation
of orbital energy from gravitational waves (GWs) can lead to captures and
subsequent inspirals with appreciable eccentricities when entering the
sensitive frequency ranges of the LIGO and Virgo GW detectors. In this study,
we perform binary-binary and binary-single scattering experiments with general
relativistic dynamics up through the 2.5 post-Newtonian order included, both in
a controlled setting to gauge the importance of non-dissipative post-Newtonian
terms and derive scaling relations for the cross-section of GW captures, as
well as experiments tuned to the strong interactions from state-of-the art
globular cluster models to assess the relative importance of the binary-binary
channel at facilitating GW captures and the resultant eccentricity
distributions of inspiral from channel. Although binary-binary interactions are
10-100 times less frequent in globular clusters than binary-single
interactions, their longer lifetime and more complex dynamics leads to a higher
probability for GW captures to occur during the encounter. We find that
binary-binary interactions contribute 25-45% of the eccentric mergers which
occur during strong black hole encounters in globular clusters, regardless of
the properties of the cluster environment. The inclusion of higher multiplicity
encounters in dense star clusters therefore have major implications on the
predicted rates of highly eccentric binaries potentially detectable by the
LIGO/Virgo network. As gravitational waveforms of eccentric inspirals are
distinct from those generated by merging binaries which have circularized,
measurements of eccentricity in such systems would highly constrain their
formation scenario.","astro-ph.HE, gr-qc",1810.00901v2,Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz,"Michael Zevin, Johan Samsing, Carl Rodriguez, Carl-Johan Haster, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz","18 pages, 6 figures. Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical

investigated at the LHC Run 2 experiments, following its decay mode via top and
bottom quark focusing on both hadronic and leptonic signal final states. The
generic two Higgs doublet model framework is considered with a special emphasis
on supersymmetry motivated Type II model. The signal is found to heavily
affected by the huge irreducible backgrounds due to the top pair production and
QCD events. The jet substructure technique is used to tag moderately boosted
top jets in order to reconstruct charged Higgs mass. The simple cut based
analysis is performed optimizing various kinematic selections, and the signal
sensitivity is found to be reasonable for only lower range of charged Higgs
masses for very high luminosity 3000 fb$^{-1}$ option. However, employing the
multi-variate analysis(MVA) technique, a remarkable improvement in signal
sensitivity is achieved. We find, the charged Higgs signal for the mass range
about $300-600$ is observable with 1000 fb$^{-1}$ luminosity option. However,
for more high luminosity option 3000 fb$^{-1}$, the discovery potential can be
extended to $700-800$ GeV.","hep-ph, hep-ex",1806.01317v2,Aravind H. Vijay,"Monoranjan Guchait, Aravind H. Vijay","38 pages, 7 figures, simple tex Made significant additions to content

semi-leptonic decays of $B$-mesons, such as the excess in the $R_{D^{(\ast)}}$
measurements. These anomalies seem to suggest intriguing hints of lepton flavor
non-universality, and the R-parity violating (RPV) interactions are candidates
for explaining this non-universality. In this paper, we discuss the RPV
interactions for resolving the $R_{D^{(\ast)}}$ anomaly with the Grand Unified
Theory (GUT) assumption. To solve the $R_{D^{(\ast)}}$ anomaly, it is known
that large RPV couplings and around $1~{\rm TeV}$ sfermion masses are required.
At the same time, large RPV couplings are conducive to realize the bottom-tau
Yukawa unification which appears in the GUT models. On the other hand, there
are problems for realizing favorable sfermion masses in the constrained minimal
supersymetric standard model. To resolve these problems, we show that two
non-universalities, the non-universal sfermion masses and the non-universal
gaugino masses, are favorable.","hep-ph, hep-ex",1808.01419v2,Ya-Dong Yang,"Quan-Yi Hu, Xin-Qiang Li, Yu Muramatsu, Ya-Dong Yang","21 pages, 2 tables, 6 figures; more discussions and references added,

generative deep learning. To simulate physical processes it is not only
important to produce physical events, but also to produce the events with the
right frequency of occurrence (density). We investigate the feasibility to
learn the event generation and the frequency of occurrence with Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to produce
events like Monte Carlo generators. We study three toy models from high energy
physics, i.e. a simple two-body decay, the processes $e^+e^-\to Z \to l^+l^-$
and $p p \to t\bar{t} $ including the decay of the top quarks and a simulation
of the detector response. We show that GANs and the standard VAE do not produce
the right distributions. By buffering density information of Monte Carlo events
in latent space given the encoder of a VAE we are able to construct a prior for
the sampling of new events from the decoder that yields distributions that are
in very good agreement with real Monte Carlo events and are generated
$\mathcal{O}(10^8)$ times faster. Applications of this work include generic
density estimation and sampling, targeted event generation via a principal
component analysis of encoded events in the latent space and the possibility to
generate better random numbers for importance sampling, e.g. for the phase
space integration of matrix elements in quantum perturbation theories. The

http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00995v1,"We study the physical conditions for the occurrence of ferromagnetic
instability in a neutral plasma of fermions. We consider a system of two
species $M$ and $Y$ which are oppositely charged under a local $U(1)_{X}$, with
$M$ much lighter than $Y$. The leading correction to free quasiparticle
behaviour for the lighter species arises from the exchange interaction, while
the heavier species remain spectators. This plasma, which is abelian,
asymmetric and idealised, is shown to be naturally susceptible to the formation
of a completely spin-imbalanced ferromagnetic state for the lighter species
(dubbed a magnino) in large parts of parameter space. It is shown that the
domain structure formed by this ferromagnetic state can mimic Dark Energy,
determining the masses of the two fermion species involved, depending on their
abundance relative to the standard photons. Incomplete cancellation of the
X-magnetic fields among the domains can give rise to residual long range
$X$-magnetic fields. Under the assumption that this $U(1)_{X}$ mixes with
Maxwell electromagnetism, this provides a mechanism for the seed for
cosmic-scale magnetic fields. An extended model with several flavours $M_a$ and
$Y_a$ of the species can incorporate Dark Matter. Thus the scenario shows the
potential for explaining the large scale magnetic fields, and what are arguably
the two most important outstanding puzzles of cosmology: Dark Matter and Dark
Energy.","astro-ph.CO, hep-ph",1901.00995v1,U. A. Yajnik,"R. B. MacKenzie, M. B. Paranjape, U. A. Yajnik",34 pages 10 figures,2019-01-07 20:13:01,No journal ref found,U. A.

developed. This mechanism is realized with a Lagrangian including a complex
scalar field and a neutral scalar field. The complex scalar carries U(1) charge
which is associated with the PNA. It is written in terms of the condensation
and Green's function, which is obtained with two-particle irreducible (2PI)
closed time path (CTP) effective action (EA). In the spatially flat universe
with a time-dependent scale factor, the time evolution of the PNA is computed.
We start with an initial condition where only the condensation of the neutral
scalar is non-zero. The initial condition for the fields is specified by a
density operator parameterized by the temperature of the universe. With the
above initial conditions, the PNA vanishes at the initial time and later it is
generated through the interaction between the complex scalar and the
condensation of the neutral scalar. We investigate the case that both the
interaction and the expansion rate of the universe are small and include their
effects up to the first order of the perturbation. The expanding universe
causes the effects of the dilution of the PNA, freezing interaction and the
redshift of the particle energy. As for the time dependence of the PNA, we
found that PNA oscillates at the early time and it begins to dump at the later
time. The period and the amplitude of the oscillation depend on the mass
spectrum of the model, the temperature and the expansion rate of the universe.","hep-th, gr-qc, hep-ph",1709.08781v5,Hiroyuki Takata (TSPU),"Takuya Morozumi, Keiko I. Nagao, Apriadi Salim Adam, Hiroyuki Takata","59 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables. In version 5, section II and III are

our new effective model includes the dynamical scale-anomaly effect from the
hidden QCD gluons, to explicitly break the classical-scale invariance at the
level of an effective field theory, which is known as the leading-order
scale-symmetry (LOSS). In the phenomenological analysis, the proposed model
predicts a light composite dilaton composed of hidden scalar quarks and gluons
with the mass around electroweak scale (around 280 GeV), and has only one input
parameter, which is the mixing angle between the Higgs boson and the composite
dilaton. Our result for the dilaton mass is in accord with the lattice
simulation for scalar QCD, where the scalar-quark bound states acquire a large
effective mass from the hidden gluon contribution. Furthermore, we predict
several significant deviations from the SM, like the resonant and non-resonant
diHiggs production cross sections (maximally about 6.8 times larger than the SM
prediction), that could be directly tested at the high luminosity LHC. It is
also the first study for the diHiggs production signal predicted from a

disentangle their fundamental properties caused by the cosmological model or

developed. This mechanism is realized with a Lagrangian including a complex
scalar field and a neutral scalar field. The complex scalar carries U(1) charge
which is associated with the PNA. It is written in terms of the condensation
and Green's function, which is obtained with two-particle irreducible (2PI)

We start with an initial condition where only the condensation of the neutral

above initial conditions, the PNA vanishes at the initial time and later it is
generated through the interaction between the complex scalar and the

interaction and the expansion rate of the universe are small and include their
effects up to the first order of the perturbation. The expanding universe
causes the effects of the dilution of the PNA, freezing interaction and the
redshift of the particle energy. As for the time dependence of the PNA, we

reservoirs at different temperatures or chemical potentials, it cannot achieve
a global thermal equilibrium and is instead driven to a set of current-carrying
non-equilibrium states. Despite the broad relevance of such a scenario to
metallic systems, there have been limited investigations of the entanglement
structure of the resulting long-time states, in part, due to the fundamental
difficulty in solving realistic models for disordered, interacting electrons.
We investigate this problem using two ""toy"" models for coherent quantum
transport of diffusive fermions: the celebrated three-dimensional,
non-interacting Anderson model, and a class of random quantum circuits acting
on a chain of qubits, which exactly maps to a diffusive, interacting fermion
problem. Crucially, the random circuit model can also be tuned to have no
interactions between the fermions, similar to the Anderson model. We show that
the long-time states of driven non-interacting fermions exhibit volume-law
mutual information and entanglement, both for our random circuit model and for
the non-equilibrium steady-state of the Anderson model. With interactions, the
random circuit model is quantum chaotic and approaches local equilibrium, with
only short-range entanglement. These results provide a generic picture for the
emergence of local equilibrium in current-driven quantum-chaotic systems, as
well as provide examples of stable highly-entangled many-body states out of

belonging to a certain $l_2$-Sobolev-ball $B_t$ of radius $R>0$ with smoothness
level $t>0$ indeed exhibits a higher smoothness level $s>t$, that is, belongs
to $B_s$. We assume that only a perturbed version of $f$ is available, where
the noise is governed by a standard Brownian motion scaled by
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$. More precisely, considering a testing problem of the form
$$H_0:~f\in B_s~~\mathrm{vs.}~~H_1:~\inf_{h\in B_s}\Vert f-h\Vert_{L_2}>\rho$$
for some $\rho>0$, we approach the task of identifying the smallest value for
$\rho$, denoted $\rho^\ast$, enabling the existence of a test $\varphi$ with
small error probability in a minimax sense. By deriving lower and upper bounds
on $\rho^\ast$, we expose its precise dependence on $n$: $$\rho^\ast\sim
n^{-\frac{t}{2t+1/2}}.$$ As a remarkable aspect of this composite-composite
testing problem, it turns out that the rate does not depend on $s$ and is equal
to the rate in signal detection, i.e. the case of a simple null hypothesis.","math.ST, stat.TH, 62G10",1901.00880v1,Maurilio Gutzeit,Maurilio Gutzeit,No comment found,2019-01-07 20:14:13,No journal ref found,Maurilio Gutzeit,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00880v1,math.ST,2019-01-03T19:09:34Z,"Minimax $L_2$-Separation Rate in Testing the Sobolev-Type Regularity of

deep learning, but there is still little understanding as to what
representations a neural network actually learns. To better understand this,
subspace match was recently proposed as a method for assessing the similarity

networks with the same architecture trained from different initializations
learn representations that at hidden layers show low similarity when assessed
with subspace match, even when the output layers show high similarity and the
networks largely exhibit similar performance on classification tasks. In this
note, we present a simple example motivated by standard results in commutative
algebra to illustrate how this can happen, and show that although the subspace
match at a hidden layer may be 0, the representations learned may be isomorphic
as vector spaces. This leads us to conclude that a subspace match comparison of
learned representations may well be uninformative, and it points to the need
for better methods of understanding learned representations.","cs.LG, cs.NE, math.AC, stat.ML",1901.00884v1,Jeremiah Johnson,Jeremiah Johnson,No comment found,2019-01-07 20:14:15,No journal ref found,Jeremiah Johnson,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00884v1,cs.LG,2019-01-03T19:17:45Z,"Subspace Match Probably Does Not Accurately Assess the Similarity of

large scale ill-posed linear inverse problems arising from image restoration.
In order to accelerate the computation, two different hidden structures are
exploited. First, the coefficient matrix is approximated as the sum of a small
number of Kronecker products. This procedure not only introduces one more level
of parallelism into the computation but also enables the usage of
computationally intensive matrix-matrix multiplications in the subsequent
optimization procedure. We then derive the corresponding Tikhonov regularized
minimization model and extend the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding
algorithm (FISTA) to solve the resulting optimization problem. Since the
matrices appearing in the Kronecker product approximation are all structured
matrices (Toeplitz, Hankel, etc.), we can further exploit their fast
matrix-vector multiplication algorithms at each iteration. The proposed
algorithm is thus called structured fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding
algorithm (sFISTA). In particular, we show that the approximation error
introduced by sFISTA is well under control and sFISTA can reach the same image

focus a number of practical issues in form factor user equipment (UE) design.
With wavelengths becoming smaller, antenna gain patterns becoming directional,

use a number of antenna modules at different locations of the UE for good
performance. While more antennas/modules can enhance beamforming array gains,
it comes with the tradeoff of higher component cost, power consumption of the
associated radio frequency circuitry, and a beam management overhead in
learning the appropriate beam weights. Thus, the goal of a good UE design is to
provide robust spherical coverage corresponding to good array gains over the
entire sphere around the UE with a low beam management overhead, complexity,
and cost. The scope of this paper is to study the implications of two popular

http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00971v1,"The evolving Fifth Generation New Radio (5G-NR) cellular standardization
efforts at the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) brings into focus a
number of questions on relevant research problems in physical-layer
communications for study by both academia and industry. To address this
question, we show that the peak download data rates for both WiFi and cellular
systems have been scaling exponentially with time over the last twenty five
years. While keeping up with the historic cellular trends will be possible in
the near-term with a modest bandwidth and hardware complexity expansion, even a
reasonable stretching of this road-map into the far future would require
significant bandwidth accretion, perhaps possible at the millimeter wave,
sub-millimeter wave, or Terahertz (THz) regimes. The consequent increase in
focus on systems at higher carrier frequencies necessitates a paradigm shift
from the reuse of over-simplified (yet mathematically elegant) models, often
inherited from sub-6 GHz systems, to a more holistic view where real
measurements guide, motivate and refine the building of relevant but possibly
complicated models, solution space(s), and good solutions. To motivate the need
for this shift, we illustrate how the traditional abstraction fails to
correctly estimate the delay spread of millimeter wave wireless channels and
hand blockage losses at higher carrier frequencies. We conclude this paper with
a broad set of implications for future research prospects at the physical-layer
including key use-cases, possible research policy initiatives, and structural
changes needed in telecommunications departments at universities.","cs.IT, eess.SP, math.IT",1901.00971v1,Junyi Li,"Vasanthan Raghavan, Junyi Li","11 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, Accepted for publication in IEEE

most widely and successfully used ones in industrial processes, it is of vital
importance to investigate theoretically the rationale of this ubiquitous
controller in dealing with nonlinearity and uncertainty. Recently, we have
investigated the capability of the classical PID control for second order
nonlinear uncertain systems and provided some analytic design methods for the
choices of PID parameters, where the system is assumed to be in the canonical
form of cascade integrators. In this paper, we will consider the natural
extension of the classical PID control for high order affine-nonlinear
uncertain systems. In contrast to most of the literature on controller design
of nonlinear systems, we do not require such special system structures as
pure-feedback form, thanks to the strong robustness of the extend PID
controller. To be specific, we will show that under some suitable conditions on
nonlinearity and uncertainty of the systems, the extended PID controller can
globally(or semi-globally) stabilize the nonlinear uncertain systems, and at
the same time the regulation error converges to $0$ exponentially fast, as long

environmental objects with reconfigurable metasurfaces that are capable of
modifying the radio waves impinging upon them according to the generalized law
of reflection. By relying on tools from point processes, stochastic geometry,

modified random line process of fixed length, and with random orientations and
locations. Based on the proposed modeling approach, we develop the first
analytical framework that provides one with the probability that a randomly
distributed object that is coated with a reconfigurable metasurface acts as a
reflector for a given pair of transmitter and receiver. In contrast to the
conventional network setup where the environmental objects are not coated with
reconfigurable metasurfaces, we prove that the probability that the typical
random object acts as a reflector is independent of the length of the object
itself. The proposed analytical approach is validated against Monte Carlo

with the compatibility condition $u_0(x) = g(x,0)$, $x\in \partial \Omega$.
  We show that the (unique) solution to this problem exists in the viscosity
sense and can be approximated by the value function of a two-player zero-sum
game as the parameter measuring the size of the step that we move in each round
of the game goes to zero.
  In addition, when the boundary datum is independent of time, $g(x,t) =g(x)$,
we show that viscosity solutions to this evolution problem stabilize and
converge exponentially fast to the unique stationary solution as $t\to \infty$.
For $j=1$ the limit profile is just the convex envelope inside $\Omega$ of the
boundary datum $g$, while for $j=N$ it is the concave envelope. We obtain this
result with two different techniques: with PDE tools and and with game
theoretical arguments. Moreover, in some special cases (for affine boundary

$Q_n(f)$ with $n$ nodes and positive numbers converges to the integral $I(f)$
of a continuous function $f$ provided $Q_n(f)=I(f)$ for a space of algebraic
polynomials of certain degree that depends on $n$. The classical case when the
algebraic degree of precision is the highest possible is well-known and the
quadrature formulas are the Gaussian ones whose nodes coincide with the zeros
of the corresponding orthogonal polynomials and the numbers are expressed in
terms of the so-called kernel polynomials. In many cases it is reasonable to
relax the requirement for the highest possible degree of precision in order to
gain the possibility to either approximate integrals of more specific
continuous functions that contain a polynomial factor or to include additional
fixed nodes. The construction of such quadrature processes is related to
quasi-orthogonal polynomials. Given a sequence $\left \{ P_{n}\right
\}_{n\geq0}$ of monic orthogonal polynomials and a fixed integer $k$, we
establish necessary and sufficient conditions so that the quasi-orthogonal
polynomials $\left \{ Q_{n}\right \}_{n\geq0}$ defined by \[ Q_{n}(x) =P_{n}(x)

integer program of the form $\max \{ c^T x \mid Ax = b, l \leq x \leq u, x \in

consists roughly of $n$ repetition of a block matrix $A$ on the vertical line
and $n$ repetitions of a matrix $B \in \mathbb{Z}^{t \times r}$ on the
diagonal. In this paper we improve upon an algorithmic result by Hemmecke and
Schultz form 2003 to solve $2$-stage stochastic IPs. The algorithm is based on
the Graver augmentation framework where our main contribution is to give an
explicit double exponential bound on the size of the augmenting steps. The
previous bound for the size of the augmenting steps relied on non-constructive
finiteness arguments from computational algebra and therefore only am implicit
bound was known that depends on parameters $r,s,t$ and $\Delta$, where $\Delta$
is the largest entry od the constraint matrix. Our new improved bound however
is obtained by a novel theorem which argues about the intersection of paths in
a vector space. As a result of our new bound we obtain an algorithm to solve

http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01137v1,"Rare events attract more attention and interests in many scenarios of big
data such as anomaly detection and security systems. To characterize the rare
events importance from probabilistic perspective, the message importance
measure (MIM) is proposed as a kind of semantics analysis tool. Similar to
Shannon entropy, the MIM has its special functional on information processing,
in which the parameter $\varpi$ of MIM plays a vital role. Actually, the
parameter $\varpi$ dominates the properties of MIM, based on which the MIM has
three work regions where the corresponding parameters satisfy $ 0 \le \varpi
\le 2/\max\{p(x_i)\}$, $\varpi > 2/\max\{p(x_i)\}$ and $\varpi < 0$
respectively. Furthermore, in the case $ 0 \le \varpi \le 2/\max\{p(x_i)\}$,
there are some similarity between the MIM and Shannon entropy in the
information compression and transmission, which provide a new viewpoint for
information theory. This paper first constructs a system model with message
importance measure and proposes the message importance loss to enrich the
information processing strategies. Moreover, we propose the message importance
loss capacity to measure the information importance harvest in a transmission.
Furthermore, the message importance distortion function is presented to give an
upper bound of information compression based on message importance measure.
Additionally, the bitrate transmission constrained by the message importance
loss is investigated to broaden the scope for Shannon information theory.","cs.IT, math.IT, math.ST, stat.TH",1901.01137v1,Pingyi Fan,"Rui She, Shanyun Liu, Pingyi Fan",No comment found,2019-01-07 20:16:30,No journal ref found,Pingyi Fan,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.01137v1,cs.IT,2019-01-04T14:36:04Z,"Information Measure Similarity Theory: Message Importance Measure via

Power Transfer (WPT) has recently emerged in the communication literature.
Promising signal strategies to maximize the power transfer efficiency of WPT
rely on (energy) beamforming, waveform, modulation and transmit diversity, and
a combination thereof. The study of those strategies has so far been limited to
theoretical performance analysis. In this paper, we study the real over-the-air
performance of all the aforementioned signal strategies for WPT. To that end,
we have designed, prototyped and experimented an innovative radiative WPT
architecture based on Software-Defined Radio (SDR) that can operate in
open-loop and closed-loop (with channel acquisition at the transmitter) modes.
The prototype consists of three important blocks, namely the channel estimator,
the signal generator, and the energy harvester. The experiments have been
conducted in a variety of deployments, including frequency flat and frequency
selective channels, under static and mobility conditions. Experiments highlight
that a channel-adaptive WPT architecture relying on a 2-transmit antenna
16-sinewave waveform offers a 350\% performance improvement in harvested DC
power over a conventional single-antenna continuous wave. The experimental
results fully validate the observations predicted from the theoretical signal
designs and confirm the crucial and beneficial role played by the energy

http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07799v2,"Packing rings into a minimum number of rectangles is an optimization problem
which appears naturally in the logistics operations of the tube industry. It
encompasses two major difficulties, namely the positioning of rings in
rectangles and the recursive packing of rings into other rings. This problem is
known as the Recursive Circle Packing Problem (RCPP). We present the first
dedicated method for solving RCPP that provides strong dual bounds based on an
exact Dantzig--Wolfe reformulation of a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear
programming formulation. The key idea of this reformulation is to break
symmetry on each recursion level by enumerating one-level packings, i.e.,
packings of circles into other circles, and by dynamically generating packings
of circles into rectangles. We use column generation techniques to design a
""price-and-verify"" algorithm that solves this reformulation to global
optimality. Extensive computational experiments on a large test set show that
our method not only computes tight dual bounds, but often produces primal
solutions better than those computed by heuristics from the literature.","math.OC, cs.DM",1702.07799v2,João Pedro Pedroso,"Ambros Gleixner, Stephen Maher, Benjamin Müller, João Pedro Pedroso",No comment found,2019-01-07 20:17:36,No journal ref found,João Pedro Pedroso,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.07799v2,math.OC,2017-02-24T23:23:51Z,Exact Methods for Recursive Circle Packing,2019-01-07 20:17:36

nonclassical information structures. The class of problems we consider entail
the decentralized output feedback control of a linear time-varying system over
a finite horizon, subject to polyhedral constraints on the state and input
trajectories, and sparsity constraints on the controller's information
structure. As the determination of optimal control policies for such systems is
known to be computationally intractable in general, considerable effort has
been made in the literature to identify efficiently computable, albeit
suboptimal, feasible control policies. The construction of computationally
tractable bounds on their suboptimality is the primary motivation for the
techniques developed in this note. Specifically, given a decentralized control
problem with nonclassical information, we characterize an expansion of the
given information structure, which ensures its partial nestedness, while
maximizing the optimal value of the resulting decentralized control problem
under the expanded information structure. The resulting decentralized control
problem is cast as an infinite-dimensional convex program, which is further
relaxed via a partial dualization and restriction to affine dual control

http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03789v2,"Multishot network coding is considered in a worst-case adversarial setting in
which an omniscient adversary with unbounded computational resources may inject
erroneous packets in up to $t$ links, erase up to $\rho$ packets, and wire-tap
up to $\mu$ links, all throughout $\ell$ shots of a linearly-coded network.
Assuming no knowledge of the underlying linear network code (in particular, the
network topology and underlying linear code may be random and change with
time), a coding scheme achieving zero-error communication and perfect secrecy
is obtained based on linearized Reed-Solomon codes. The scheme achieves the
maximum possible secret message size of $ \ell n^\prime - 2t - \rho - \mu $
packets for coherent communication, where $ n^\prime $ is the number of
outgoing links at the source, for any packet length $ m \geq n^\prime $
(largest possible range). By lifting this construction, coding schemes for
non-coherent communication are obtained with information rates close to optimal
for practical instances. The required field size is $ q^m $, where $ q > \ell
$, thus $ q^m \approx \ell^{n^\prime} $, which is always smaller than that of a
Gabidulin code tailored for $ \ell $ shots, which would be at least $ 2^{\ell
n^\prime} $. A Welch-Berlekamp sum-rank decoding algorithm for linearized
Reed-Solomon codes is provided, having quadratic complexity in the total length
$n = \ell n^\prime $, and which can be adapted to handle not only errors, but
also erasures, wire-tap observations and non-coherent communication. Combined
with the obtained field size, the given decoding complexity is of $
\mathcal{O}(n^{\prime 4} \ell^2 \log(\ell)^2) $ operations in $ \mathbb{F}_2 $.","cs.IT, math.IT",1805.03789v2,Frank R. Kschischang,"Umberto Martínez-Peñas, Frank R.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07278v2,"A fundamental tool to prove inner bounds in classical network information
theory is the so-called `conditional joint typicality lemma'. In addition to
the lemma, one often uses unions and intersections of typical sets in the inner
bound arguments without so much as giving them a second thought. These
arguments fail spectacularly in the quantum setting. This bottleneck shows up
in the fact that so-called `simultaneous decoders', as opposed to `successive
cancellation decoders', are known for very few channels in quantum network
information theory. Another manifestation of this bottleneck is the lack of
so-called `simutaneous smoothing' theorems for quantum states.
  In this paper, we overcome the bottleneck by proving for the first time a
one-shot quantum joint typicality lemma with robust union and intersection
properties. To do so, we develop two novel tools in quantum information theory
which may be of independent interest. The first tool is a simple geometric idea
called `tilting', which increases the angles between a family of subspaces in
orthogonal directions. The second tool, called `smoothing', is a way of
perturbing a multipartite quantum state such that the partial trace over any
subset of registers does not increase the operator norm by much.
  Our joint typicality lemma allows us to construct simultaneous quantum
decoders for many multiterminal quantum channels. It provides a powerful tool
to extend many results in classical network information theory to the one-shot

problem of designing molecular circuits for demodulation. In our earlier work,

differential equation which computes the log-posteriori probability of a
transmission symbol being sent. This work considers the realisation of these
demodulation filters using molecular circuits assuming the transmission symbols
are rectangular pulses of the same duration but different amplitudes, i.e.
concentration modulation. This paper makes a number of contributions. First, we
use time-scale separation and renewal theory to analytically derive an
approximation of the demodulation filter from our earlier work. Second, we
present a method to turn this approximation into a molecular circuit. By using
simulation, we show that the output of the derived molecular circuit is
approximately equal to the log-posteriori probability calculated by the exact
demodulation filter if the log-posteriori probability is positive. Third, we
demonstrate that a biochemical circuit in yeast behaves similarly to the
derived molecular demodulation filter and is therefore a candidate for
implementing the derived filter.","cs.IT, math.IT",1808.01543v3,Chun Tung Chou,Chun Tung Chou,No comment found,2019-01-07 20:18:35,No journal ref found,Chun Tung Chou,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.01543v3,cs.IT,2018-08-05T00:25:18Z,"Designing molecular circuits for approximate maximum a posteriori

in a multi-source system, where sources communicate their update packets to a
destination via a channel with random delay. Due to interference, only one
source can be scheduled at a time. We consider the problem of finding a
decision policy that controls the packet sampling times and schedules source
transmissions to minimize the total average peak age (TaPA) and the total
average age (TaA) of the sources. Our investigation of this problem results in
an important separation principle: The optimal scheduling strategy and the
optimal sampling strategy are independent of each other. In particular, we
prove that, given the sampling times of the update packets, the Maximum Age
First (MAF) scheduling strategy provides the best age performance among all
scheduling strategies. This transforms our overall optimization problem into an
optimal sampling problem, given that the decision policy follows the MAF
scheduling strategy. Interestingly, we show that the zero-wait sampler (in
which a packet is generated once the channel is idle) is optimal for minimizing
the TaPA, while it does not always minimize the TaA. We use Dynamic Programming

http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10593v2,"The beta transformation is the iterated map $\beta x\mod1$. The special case
of $\beta=2$ is known as the Bernoulli map, and is exactly solvable. The
Bernoulli map provides a model for pure, unrestrained chaotic (ergodic)
behavior: it is the full invariant shift on the Cantor space
$\{0,1\}^{\omega}$. The beta transformation defines a subshift: iterated on the
unit interval, it singles out a subspace of the Cantor space, in such a way
that it is invariant under the action of the left-shift operator. That is,
lopping off one bit at a time gives back the same subspace. The beta transform
seems to capture something basic about the multiplication of two real numbers:
$\beta$ and $x$. It offers a window into understanding the nature of
multiplication. Iterating on multiplication, one would get $\beta^{n}x$ - that
is, exponentiation; although the mod 1 of the beta transform contorts this in
interesting ways. The work presented here is a research diary: a pastiche of
observations and some shallow insights. One is that chaos seems to be rooted in
how the carry bit behaves during multiplication. Another is that one can
surgically insert ""islands of stability"" into chaotic (ergodic) systems, and
have some fair amount of control over how those islands of stability behave. In
particular, one can have islands with, or without a period-doubling ""route to
chaos"". The eigenvalues of the transfer operator seem to lie on a circle of
radius $1/\beta$ in the complex plane. Given that the transfer operator is
purely real, the appearance of such a quasi-unitary spectrum seems surprising.
The spectrum appears to be the limit of a dense set of quasi-cyclotomic
polynomials, the positive real roots of which include the Golden and silver
ratios, the Pisot numbers, the n-bonnaci (tribonacci, tetranacci, etc.)

obtained as well. Besides, as a by-product, a verification theorem for SOCs is
derived via viscosity solutions without involving any derivatives of the value

http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11750v2,"The stringent requirements for low-latency and privacy of the emerging
high-stake applications with intelligent devices such as drones and smart
vehicles make the cloud computing inapplicable in these scenarios. Instead,
edge machine learning becomes increasingly attractive for performing training
and inference directly at network edges without sending data to a centralized
data center. This stimulates a nascent field termed as federated learning for
training a machine learning model on computation, storage, energy and bandwidth
limited mobile devices in a distributed manner. To preserve data privacy and
address the issues of unbalanced and non-IID data points across different
devices, the federated averaging algorithm has been proposed for global model
aggregation by computing the weighted average of locally updated model at each
selected device. However, the limited communication bandwidth becomes the main
bottleneck for aggregating the locally computed updates. We thus propose a
novel over-the-air computation based approach for fast global model aggregation
via exploring the superposition property of a wireless multiple-access channel.
This is achieved by joint device selection and beamforming design, which is
modeled as a sparse and low-rank optimization problem to support efficient
algorithms design. To achieve this goal, we provide a
difference-of-convex-functions (DC) representation for the sparse and low-rank
function to enhance sparsity and accurately detect the fixed-rank constraint in
the procedure of device selection. A DC algorithm is further developed to solve
the resulting DC program with global convergence guarantees. The algorithmic

In particular our clue is to select two scenarios, i.e. $(2,2)$ Pad\'e and
$(2,1)$ Chebyshev approximations, since they well approximate the luminosity
distance at the lowest possible order. We find that best analytical matches to
the numerical solutions lead to $f(R)=a+bR^n$ with free parameters given by the
set $(a, b, n)=(-1.627, 0.866, 1.074)$ for $(2,2)$ Pad\'e approximation,
whereas $f(R)=\alpha+\beta R^m$ with $(\alpha, \beta, m)=(-1.332, 0.749,
1.124)$ for $(2,1)$ rational Chebyshev approximation. Finally, our results are
compared with the $\Lambda$CDM predictions and with previous studies in the
literature.

counter-intuitive as, for instance, counterwinding vortices start moving but
also approach each other. This lateral motion becomes weaker as the continuum

of twenty reported values of the charged-pion coupling constant, exhibiting
sizeable fluctuation, the result $f_c^2 = 0.0762^{+0.0015}_{-0.0008}$ is
obtained. Similar values are extracted for the other two $\pi N$ coupling
constants, $f_0^2$ and $f_p^2$, from fewer data. The average values of the
various $\pi N$ coupling constants, extracted in this work, suggest no
splitting, in agreement with the thesis of the Nijmegen group. Additional
analysis of the $f_c^2$ and $f_0^2$ values, both reported in four studies,
turned to be inconclusive: one of these studies strongly suggests that
$f_0<f_c$, whereas another slightly favours $f_0>f_c$; no significant effects

that estimates for the hadronic $s$-wave $\pi N$ scattering lengths be

generative deep learning. To simulate physical processes it is not only
important to produce physical events, but also to produce the events with the
right frequency of occurrence (density). We investigate the feasibility to
learn the event generation and the frequency of occurrence with Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to produce
events like Monte Carlo generators. We study three toy models from high energy
physics, i.e. a simple two-body decay, the processes $e^+e^-\to Z \to l^+l^-$
and $p p \to t\bar{t} $ including the decay of the top quarks and a simulation
of the detector response. We show that GANs and the standard VAE do not produce
the right distributions. By buffering density information of Monte Carlo events
in latent space given the encoder of a VAE we are able to construct a prior for
the sampling of new events from the decoder that yields distributions that are
in very good agreement with real Monte Carlo events and are generated
$\mathcal{O}(10^8)$ times faster. Applications of this work include generic
density estimation and sampling, targeted event generation via a principal
component analysis of encoded events in the latent space and the possibility to
generate better random numbers for importance sampling, e.g. for the phase

http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00992v1,"We describe a semi-structured method for the generation of high-order hybrid
meshes suited for the simulation of high Reynolds number flows. This is
achieved through the use of highly stretched elements in the viscous boundary
layers near the wall surfaces. CADfix is used to first repair any possible
defects in the CAD geometry and then generate a medial object based
decomposition of the domain that wraps the wall boundaries with partitions
suitable for the generation of either prismatic or hexahedral elements. The
latter is a novel distinctive feature of the method that permits to obtain
well-shaped hexahedral meshes at corners or junctions in the boundary layer.
The medial object approach allows greater control on the ""thickness"" of the
boundary-layer mesh than is generally achievable with advancing layer
techniques. CADfix subsequently generates a hybrid straight sided mesh of
prismatic and hexahedral elements in the near-field region modelling the
boundary layer, and tetrahedral elements in the far-field region covering the
rest of the domain. The mesh in the near-field region provides a framework that
facilitates the generation, via an isoparametric technique, of layers of highly
stretched elements with a distribution of points in the direction normal to the
wall tailored to efficiently and accurately capture the flow in the boundary
layer. The final step is the generation of a high-order mesh using NekMesh, a
high-order mesh generator within the Nektar++ framework. NekMesh uses the
CADfix API as a geometry engine that handles all the geometrical queries to the
CAD geometry required during the high-order mesh generation process. We will
describe in some detail the methodology using a simple geometry, a NACA wing
tip, for illustrative purposes. Finally, we will present two examples of
application to reasonably complex geometries proposed by NASA as CFD validation

driven, oscillator. Under ideal circumstances, the oscillation frequency of the
pendulum is independent of its mass and swing amplitude. However, in most
real-world situations, the dynamics of pendulums is not quite so simple,
particularly with additional interactions between the pendulum and a
surrounding fluid. Here we extend the realm of pendulum studies to include
large amplitude oscillations of heavy and buoyant pendulums in a fluid. We
performed experiments with massive and hollow cylindrical pendulums in water,
and constructed a simple model that takes the buoyancy, added mass, fluid
(nonlinear) drag, and bearing friction into account. To first order, the model
predicts the oscillation frequencies, peak decelerations and damping rate well.
An interesting effect of the nonlinear drag captured well by the model is that
for heavy pendulums, the damping time shows a non-monotonic dependence on
pendulum mass, reaching a minimum when the pendulum mass density is nearly
twice that of the fluid. Small deviations from the model's predictions are
seen, particularly in the second and subsequent maxima of oscillations. Using
Time- Resolved Particle Image Velocimetry (TR-PIV), we reveal that these
deviations likely arise due to the disturbed flow created by the pendulum at

with magnitude equal to the Coulomb force, sinusoidally modulated by the phase
difference between the circulatory motions. When the particles have equal mass
and their circulatory motions are aligned but out of phase, part of the

possibility that the quantum force of Bohmian mechanics may be attributable to

scientific citations are driven by the reputation of the reference so that the

the prestige of a set of institutions in a certain research field based only on

ordered phases of internally driven particles such as bird flocks, bacterial
suspension and their artificial analogues. While theories of orientationally
ordered phases are by now well established, the effect of chirality on these
phases is much less studied. In this paper, we present the first complete
dynamical theory of orientationally ordered chiral particles in two-dimensional
incompressible systems. We show that phase-coherent states of rotating chiral
particles are remarkably stable in both momentum-conserved and non-conserved
systems in contrast to their non-rotating counterparts. Furthermore, defect
separation -- which drives chaotic flows in non-rotating active fluids -- is
suppressed by intrinsic rotation of chiral active particles. We thus establish
chirality as a source of dramatic stabilization in active systems, which could
be key in interpreting the collective behaviours of some biological tissues,
cytoskeletal systems and collections of bacteria.","cond-mat.soft, cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.bio-ph",1804.09994v2,Martin Lenz,"Ananyo Maitra, Martin Lenz",No comment found,2019-01-07 20:22:01,No journal ref found,Martin Lenz,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.09994v2,cond-mat.soft,2018-04-26T11:15:16Z,Spontaneous rotation can stabilise ordered chiral active fluids,2019-01-07 20:22:01

Computational Materials Design (CMD). However, existing microstructure
characterization and reconstruction (MCR) techniques have limitations to be
applied for materials design. Model-based MCR approaches do not have parameters
that can serve as design variables, while MCR techniques that rely on dimension
reduction tend to lose important microstructural information. In this work, we
present a deep adversarial learning methodology that overcomes the limitations
of existing MCR techniques. In the proposed methodology, generative adversarial
networks (GAN) are trained to learn the mapping between latent variables and
microstructures. Thereafter, the low-dimensional latent variables serve as
design variables, and a Bayesian optimization framework is applied to obtain
microstructures with desired material property. Due to the special design of
the network architecture, the proposed methodology is able to identify the
latent (design) variables with desired dimensionality, as well as minimize the
information loss even for complex material microstructures. The validity of the
proposed methodology is tested numerically on a synthetic microstructure
dataset and its effectiveness for materials design is evaluated through a case
study of optimizing optical performance for energy absorption. In addition, the
scalability and transferability of proposed methodology are also demonstrated
in this work. Specifically, the proposed methodology is scalable to generate
arbitrary sized microstructures, and it can serve as a pre-trained model to

different types of diattenuation (polarisation-dependent attenuation of light)
can be observed: In some brain regions, the light is minimally attenuated when
it is polarised parallel to the nerve fibres (referred to as D+), in others, it
is maximally attenuated (referred to as D-). The underlying mechanisms of these
effects and their relationship to tissue properties were so far unknown. Here,
we demonstrate in experimental studies that diattenuation of both types D+ and
D- can be observed in brain tissue samples from different species (rodent,
monkey, and human) and that the strength and type of diattenuation depend on
the nerve fibre orientations. By combining finite-difference time-domain
simulations and analytical modelling, we explain the observed diattenuation
effects and show that they are caused both by anisotropic absorption
(dichroism) and by anisotropic light scattering. Our studies demonstrate that
the diattenuation signal depends not only on the nerve fibre orientations but
also on other brain tissue properties like tissue homogeneity, fibre size, and
myelin sheath thickness. This allows to use the diattenuation signal to
distinguish between brain regions with different tissue properties and

verification of proton pencil-beams using the prompt gamma-ray spectroscopy
method. The detection system consists of eight LaBr3 scintillators and a
tungsten collimator, mounted on a rotating frame. Custom electronics and
calibration algorithms have been developed for the measurement of energy- and
time-resolved gamma-ray spectra during proton irradiation at a clinical dose
rate. Using experimentally determined nuclear reaction cross sections and a
GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulation, a detailed model of the expected
gamma-ray emissions is created for each individual pencil-beam. The absolute
range of the proton pencil-beams is determined by minimizing the discrepancy
between the measurement and this model, leaving the absolute range of the beam
and the elemental concentrations of the irradiated matter as free parameters.
The system was characterized in a clinical-like situation by irradiating
different phantoms with a scanning pencil-beam. A dose of 0.9 Gy was delivered
to a 5x10x10 cm^3 target with a beam current of 2 nA incident on the phantom.
Different range shifters and materials were used to test the robustness of the
verification method and to calculate the accuracy of the detected range. The
absolute proton range was determined for each spot of the distal energy layer
with a mean statistical precision of 1.1 mm at a 95% confidence level and a
mean systematic deviation of 0.5 mm, when aggregating pencil-beam spots within
a cylindrical region of 10 mm radius and 10 mm depth. Small range errors that

is based on a family of sparse generalized doubles (D) operators which provides
an affordable and systematically improvable unitary coupled-cluster
wavefunction suitable for implementation on a near-term quantum computer.
$k$-UpCCGSD employs $k$ products of the exponential of pair coupled-cluster
double excitation operators (pCCD), together with generalized single (S)
excitation operators. We compare its performance in both efficiency of
implementation and accuracy with that of the generalized UCC ansatz employing
the full generalized SD excitation operators (UCCGSD), as well as with the
standard ansatz employing only SD excitations (UCCSD). $k$-UpCCGSD is found to
show the best scaling for quantum computing applications, requiring a circuit
depth of $\mathcal O(kN)$, compared with $\mathcal O(N^3)$ for UCCGSD and
$\mathcal O((N-\eta)^2 \eta)$ for UCCSD where $N$ is the number of spin
orbitals and $\eta$ is the number of electrons. We analyzed the accuracy of
these three ans\""atze by making classical benchmark calculations on the ground
state and the first excited state of H$_4$ (STO-3G, 6-31G), H$_2$O (STO-3G),
and N$_2$ (STO-3G), making additional comparisons to conventional coupled
cluster methods. The results for ground states show that $k$-UpCCGSD offers a
good tradeoff between accuracy and cost, achieving chemical accuracy for lower
cost of implementation on quantum computers than both UCCGSD and UCCSD. Excited
states are calculated with an orthogonally constrained variational quantum
eigensolver approach. This is seen to generally yield less accurate energies
than for the corresponding ground states. We demonstrate that using a
specialized multi-determinantal reference state constructed from classical
linear response calculations allows these excited state energetics to be
improved.","quant-ph, cond-mat.str-el, physics.chem-ph, physics.comp-ph",1810.02327v2,K. Birgitta Whaley,"Joonho Lee, William J. Huggins, Martin Head-Gordon, K.

Adversarial Networks (GAN) has been recently demonstrated (Laloy et al., 2018).
Compared to searching through the original model space, using the latent space
of a trained GAN can offer the following benefits: (1) the generated model
proposals are geostatistically consistent with the prescribed prior training
image (TI), and (2) the parameter space is reduced by orders of magnitude
compared to the original model space. Nevertheless, exploring the learned
latent space by state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods may
still require a large computational effort. Instead, this latent space could
also be combined with much less computationally expensive gradient-based
deterministic inversions. This study shows that due to the highly nonlinear
relationship between the latent space and associated output space of a GAN,
gradient-based deterministic inversion frequently fails when considering a
linear forward model. For a channelized aquifer binary TI and a linear ground
penetrating radar (GPR) tomography problem involving 576 measurements with low
noise, we observe that only 0\% to 5\% of the gradient-based inversion trials
locate a solution that has the required data misfit, with the performance

accelerated electron spectrum. However, the standard approach using the
collisional cold thick-target model poorly constrains the lower-energy part of
the accelerated electron spectrum, and hence the overall energetics of the

orders of magnitude. Here we develop and apply a physically self-consistent
warm-target approach which involves the use of both hard X-ray spectroscopy and

the contribution of accelerated electrons to the total energy released, by
constraining the coronal plasma parameters. Using a solar flare observed in
X-rays by the {\em RHESSI} spacecraft, we demonstrate that using the standard
cold-target methodology, the low-energy cutoff (and hence the energy content in
electrons) is essentially undetermined. However, the warm-target methodology
can determine the low-energy electron cutoff with $\sim$7\% uncertainty at the

in successive stages. Neural representations vary drastically across the first
stages of visual processing: at the output of the retina, ganglion cell
receptive fields (RFs) exhibit a clear antagonistic center-surround structure,
whereas in the primary visual cortex, typical RFs are sharply tuned to a
precise orientation. There is currently no unified theory explaining these
differences in representations across layers. Here, using a deep convolutional
neural network trained on image recognition as a model of the visual system, we
show that such differences in representation can emerge as a direct consequence
of different neural resource constraints on the retinal and cortical networks,
and we find a single model from which both geometries spontaneously emerge at
the appropriate stages of visual processing. The key constraint is a reduced
number of neurons at the retinal output, consistent with the anatomy of the
optic nerve as a stringent bottleneck. Second, we find that, for simple
cortical networks, visual representations at the retinal output emerge as
nonlinear and lossy feature detectors, whereas they emerge as linear and
faithful encoders of the visual scene for more complex cortices. This result
predicts that the retinas of small vertebrates should perform sophisticated
nonlinear computations, extracting features directly relevant to behavior,
whereas retinas of large animals such as primates should mostly encode the
visual scene linearly and respond to a much broader range of stimuli. These
predictions could reconcile the two seemingly incompatible views of the retina
as either performing feature extraction or efficient coding of natural scenes,
by suggesting that all vertebrates lie on a spectrum between these two
objectives, depending on the degree of neural resources allocated to their

this paper, we will study the systemic risk measures on a special space

universal quantum computation -- by a Zeeman-like control field with two

We subsequently introduce important practical considerations, such as finite
frequency bandwidth of realistic fields and their leakage away from the
actuator. We find the shortest times required for high-fidelity Toffoli- and
Fredkin-gate realizations and provide comparisons to their respective two-qubit

between two similar particles each consisting of a point charge moving with
circulatory motion at the speed of light. Supposition of such motion is the

difference between the circulatory motions. When the particles have equal mass

possibility that the quantum force of Bohmian mechanics may be attributable to
the magnetic force of classical electrodynamics. It is further shown that

reservoirs at different temperatures or chemical potentials, it cannot achieve
a global thermal equilibrium and is instead driven to a set of current-carrying
non-equilibrium states. Despite the broad relevance of such a scenario to
metallic systems, there have been limited investigations of the entanglement
structure of the resulting long-time states, in part, due to the fundamental
difficulty in solving realistic models for disordered, interacting electrons.
We investigate this problem using two ""toy"" models for coherent quantum
transport of diffusive fermions: the celebrated three-dimensional,
non-interacting Anderson model, and a class of random quantum circuits acting
on a chain of qubits, which exactly maps to a diffusive, interacting fermion
problem. Crucially, the random circuit model can also be tuned to have no
interactions between the fermions, similar to the Anderson model. We show that
the long-time states of driven non-interacting fermions exhibit volume-law
mutual information and entanglement, both for our random circuit model and for
the non-equilibrium steady-state of the Anderson model. With interactions, the
random circuit model is quantum chaotic and approaches local equilibrium, with
only short-range entanglement. These results provide a generic picture for the
emergence of local equilibrium in current-driven quantum-chaotic systems, as
well as provide examples of stable highly-entangled many-body states out of

the lemma, one often uses unions and intersections of typical sets in the inner

in the fact that so-called `simultaneous decoders', as opposed to `successive

called `tilting', which increases the angles between a family of subspaces in
orthogonal directions. The second tool, called `smoothing', is a way of
perturbing a multipartite quantum state such that the partial trace over any

$k$-UpCCGSD employs $k$ products of the exponential of pair coupled-cluster

implementation and accuracy with that of the generalized UCC ansatz employing

$\mathcal O((N-\eta)^2 \eta)$ for UCCSD where $N$ is the number of spin

settlements. However, data regarding informal and formal settlements is
primarily unavailable and if available is often incomplete. This is due, in
part, to the cost and complexity of gathering data on a large scale. An
additional complication is that the definition of an informal settlement is
also very broad, which makes it a non-trivial task to collect data. This also
makes it challenging to teach a machine what to look for. Due to these
challenges we provide three contributions in this work. 1) A brand new machine
learning data-set, purposely developed for informal settlement detection that
contains a series of low and very-high resolution imagery, with accompanying
ground truth annotations marking the locations of known informal settlements.
2) We demonstrate that it is possible to detect informal settlements using
freely available low-resolution (LR) data, in contrast to previous studies that
use very-high resolution (VHR) satellite and aerial imagery, which is typically
cost-prohibitive for NGOs. 3) We demonstrate two effective classification
schemes on our curated data set, one that is cost-efficient for NGOs and
another that is cost-prohibitive for NGOs, but has additional utility. We
integrate these schemes into a semi-automated pipeline that converts either a

http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01007v1,"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have revolutionized numerous applications, but
the demand for ever more performance remains unabated. Scaling DNN computations
to larger clusters is generally done by distributing tasks in batch mode using
methods such as distributed synchronous SGD. Among the issues with this
approach is that to make the distributed cluster work with high utilization,
the workload distributed to each node must be large, which implies nontrivial
growth in the SGD mini-batch size.
  In this paper, we propose a framework called FPDeep, which uses a hybrid of
model and layer parallelism to configure distributed reconfigurable clusters to
train DNNs. This approach has numerous benefits. First, the design does not
suffer from batch size growth. Second, novel workload and weight partitioning
leads to balanced loads of both among nodes. And third, the entire system is a
fine-grained pipeline. This leads to high parallelism and utilization and also
minimizes the time features need to be cached while waiting for
back-propagation. As a result, storage demand is reduced to the point where
only on-chip memory is used for the convolution layers. We evaluate FPDeep with
the Alexnet, VGG-16, and VGG-19 benchmarks. Experimental results show that
FPDeep has good scalability to a large number of FPGAs, with the limiting
factor being the FPGA-to-FPGA bandwidth. With 6 transceivers per FPGA, FPDeep
shows linearity up to 83 FPGAs. Energy efficiency is evaluated with respect to
GOPs/J. FPDeep provides, on average, 6.36x higher energy efficiency than
comparable GPU servers.","cs.LG, cs.AR, cs.DC, stat.ML",1901.01007v1,Martin Herbordt,"Tong Geng, Tianqi Wang, Ang Li, Xi Jin, Martin Herbordt","20 pages, 20 figures",2019-01-07 20:24:35,No journal ref found,Martin Herbordt,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.01007v1,cs.LG,2019-01-04T07:54:46Z,"A Scalable Framework for Acceleration of CNN Training on

measure (MIM) is proposed as a kind of semantics analysis tool. Similar to
Shannon entropy, the MIM has its special functional on information processing,
in which the parameter $\varpi$ of MIM plays a vital role. Actually, the
parameter $\varpi$ dominates the properties of MIM, based on which the MIM has
three work regions where the corresponding parameters satisfy $ 0 \le \varpi

respectively. Furthermore, in the case $ 0 \le \varpi \le 2/\max\{p(x_i)\}$,
there are some similarity between the MIM and Shannon entropy in the
information compression and transmission, which provide a new viewpoint for
information theory. This paper first constructs a system model with message
importance measure and proposes the message importance loss to enrich the
information processing strategies. Moreover, we propose the message importance
loss capacity to measure the information importance harvest in a transmission.
Furthermore, the message importance distortion function is presented to give an

Additionally, the bitrate transmission constrained by the message importance

prove that the Horvitz-Thompson estimator is asymptotically normally
distributed through a coupling argument. When the first-stage sampling fraction
is negligible, simplified variance estimators which do not require estimating
the variance within the Primary Sampling Units are proposed, and shown to be
consistent. An application to a panel for urban policy, which is the initial

http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01090v2,"This paper proposes a new Quantum Spatial Graph Convolutional Neural Network
(QSGCNN) model that can directly learn a classification function for graphs of
arbitrary sizes. Unlike state-of-the-art Graph Convolutional Neural Network
(GCNN) models, the proposed QSGCNN model incorporates the process of
identifying transitive aligned vertices between graphs, and transforms
arbitrary sized graphs into fixed-sized aligned vertex grid structures. In
order to learn representative graph characteristics, a new quantum spatial
graph convolution is proposed and employed to extract multi-scale vertex
features, in terms of quantum information propagation between grid vertices of
each graph. Since the quantum spatial convolution preserves the grid structures
of the input vertices (i.e., the convolution layer does not change the original
spatial sequence of vertices), the proposed QSGCNN model allows to directly
employ the traditional convolutional neural network architecture to further
learn from the global graph topology, providing an end-to-end deep learning
architecture that integrates the graph representation and learning in the
quantum spatial graph convolution layer and the traditional convolutional layer
for graph classifications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
QSGCNN model in relation to existing state-of-the-art methods. The proposed
QSGCNN model addresses the shortcomings of information loss and imprecise
information representation arising in existing GCN models associated with the
use of SortPooling or SumPooling layers. Experiments on benchmark graph
classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed QSGCNN
model.","cs.LG, stat.ML",1809.01090v2,Edwin R. Hancock,"Lu Bai, Yuhang Jiao, Luca Rossi, Lixin Cui, Jian Cheng, Edwin R. Hancock",No comment found,2019-01-07 20:25:01,No journal ref found,Edwin R.

probability, statistics, and machine learning. Despite much success in
developing upper tail bounds in literature, the lower tail bound results are

elementary proofs. In addition, we develop sharp lower tail bounds for the sum
of independent sub-Gaussian and sub-exponential random variables, which matches
the classic Hoeffding-type and Bernstein-type concentration inequalities,
respectively. We also provide non-asymptotic matching upper and lower tail
bounds for a suite of distributions, including gamma, beta, (regular, weighted,

http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10172v2,"Multidimensional scaling is an important dimension reduction tool in
statistics and machine learning. Yet few theoretical results characterizing its
statistical performance exist, not to mention any in high dimensions. By
considering a unified framework that includes low, moderate and high
dimensions, we study multidimensional scaling in the setting of clustering
noisy data. Our results suggest that, the classical multidimensional scaling
can be modified to further improve the quality of embedded samples, especially
when the noise level increases. To this end, we propose {\it modified
multidimensional scaling} which applies a nonlinear transformation to the
sample eigenvalues. The nonlinear transformation depends on the dimensionality,
sample size and moment of noise. We show that modified multidimensional scaling
followed by various clustering algorithms can achieve exact recovery, i.e., all
the cluster labels can be recovered correctly with probability tending to one.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03239v2,"This paper deals with distributed reinforcement learning (DRL), which
involves a central controller and a group of learners. In particular, two DRL
settings encountered in several applications are considered: multi-agent
reinforcement learning (RL) and parallel RL, where frequent information
exchanges between the learners and the controller are required. For many
practical distributed systems, however, such as those involving parallel
machines for training deep RL algorithms, and multi-robot systems for learning
the optimal coordination strategies, the overhead caused by these frequent
communication exchanges is considerable, and becomes the bottleneck of the
overall performance. To address this challenge, a novel policy gradient method
is developed here to cope with such communication-constrained DRL settings. The
proposed approach reduces the communication overhead without degrading learning
performance by adaptively skipping the policy gradient communication during
iterations. It is established analytically that i) the novel algorithm has
convergence rate identical to that of the plain-vanilla policy gradient for
DRL; while ii) if the distributed computing units are heterogeneous in terms of
their reward functions and initial state distributions, the number of
communication rounds needed to achieve a desirable learning accuracy is
markedly reduced. Numerical experiments on a popular multi-agent RL benchmark
corroborate the significant communication reduction attained by the novel
algorithm compared to alternatives.","cs.LG, cs.MA, stat.ML",1812.03239v2,Tamer Başar,"Tianyi Chen, Kaiqing Zhang, Georgios B.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11750v2,"The stringent requirements for low-latency and privacy of the emerging
high-stake applications with intelligent devices such as drones and smart
vehicles make the cloud computing inapplicable in these scenarios. Instead,
edge machine learning becomes increasingly attractive for performing training
and inference directly at network edges without sending data to a centralized
data center. This stimulates a nascent field termed as federated learning for
training a machine learning model on computation, storage, energy and bandwidth
limited mobile devices in a distributed manner. To preserve data privacy and
address the issues of unbalanced and non-IID data points across different
devices, the federated averaging algorithm has been proposed for global model
aggregation by computing the weighted average of locally updated model at each
selected device. However, the limited communication bandwidth becomes the main
bottleneck for aggregating the locally computed updates. We thus propose a
novel over-the-air computation based approach for fast global model aggregation
via exploring the superposition property of a wireless multiple-access channel.
This is achieved by joint device selection and beamforming design, which is
modeled as a sparse and low-rank optimization problem to support efficient
algorithms design. To achieve this goal, we provide a
difference-of-convex-functions (DC) representation for the sparse and low-rank
function to enhance sparsity and accurately detect the fixed-rank constraint in
the procedure of device selection. A DC algorithm is further developed to solve
the resulting DC program with global convergence guarantees. The algorithmic
advantages and admirable performance of the proposed methodologies are
demonstrated through extensive numerical results.","cs.LG, cs.IT, eess.SP, math.IT, stat.ML",1812.11750v2,Zhi Ding,"Kai Yang, Tao Jiang, Yuanming Shi, Zhi Ding",No comment found,2019-01-07 20:25:09,No journal ref found,Zhi Ding,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.11750v2,cs.LG,2018-12-31T10:29:57Z,Federated Learning via Over-the-Air Computation,2019-01-07 20:25:09

have developed into a powerful tool in the field of machine learning, one that
is showing to be extremely promising at computing diagnosis even with

  In this research, a cheap device was created to allow for straightforward

Zero processor ($5), the device is able to detect up to 1537 different diseases
and conditions and utilize a CNN for on-device visual diagnostics. The user can
input the symptoms using the buttons on the device and can take pictures using
the same mechanism. The algorithm processes inputted symptoms, providing
diagnosis and possible treatment options for common conditions. The purpose of
this work was to be able to diagnose diseases through an affordable processor
with high accuracy, as it is currently achieving an accuracy of 90% for Top-5
symptom-based diagnoses, and 91% for visual skin diseases. The NNs achieve
